<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> led to undertake the following Narrative
by the perusal of a work, lately published at Paris,
entitled &#8220;Histoire de L&#8217;Homme au Masque de Fer,
par J. Delort;&#8221; in which the name of that state
prisoner is most clearly and satisfactorily ascertained,
by means of authentic documents.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it may be asked
why I was not contented to leave the question, thus
set at rest, in the hands of M. Delort, who had
the original merit of the discovery:&mdash;to this I
would answer, that M. Delort&#8217;s part of the book
struck me as peculiarly ill arranged and confused;
besides being unnecessarily filled with the most fulsome
flattery of Lewis the Fourteenth, never, certainly,
more inappropriately bestowed, than while
in the act of recording one of the most cruel and
oppressive acts of that Sovereign&#8217;s cruel and oppressive
reign.</p>

<p>I have also thought, that the subject was one of
sufficient historical curiosity to interest the English
public.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I have been induced to throw
together the following chain of evidence upon the
subject, making use of the same documents as M.
Delort, to which I have added some others previously
published, and printing the whole series
in an Appendix.</p>

THE IRON MASK.</h2>
<hr class="section" />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> curiosity of the public has been now, for
above a century, so much wrought upon by the,
mystery which has enveloped the name of the
Iron Mask, (or as the French more properly designate
him, &#8220;<i>the Man of the Iron Mask</i>,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="footnote-anchor">1</a>) that
the eagerness for discovery has thus been carried
much farther than the real importance of the
subject deserved. Numerous have been the papers
written, and the conjectures hazarded in favour of
different theories; almost all presenting, at first<a class="page" name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a>
view, some semblance of probability; but all, without
exception, crumbling to nothing when exposed
to the researches of accurate inquiry. Under these
circumstances, it is certainly satisfactory, that the
question should be finally set at rest.</p>

<p>It is singular, that among all the inquiries hitherto
made respecting the Iron Mask, no one
seems ever to have thought of recurring to the only
source from whence true information could be derived&mdash;the
archives of the French Government,
during the reign of Lewis the Fourteenth. It was
reserved for M. Delort to make these researches;
which he did by the permission of the Count
d&#8217;Hauterive, Keeper of the Archives of the office
of Secretary of State for the Foreign department,
and the result has been perfectly conclusive. In
those archives, he found the continued correspondence
of the French ministers, proving, beyond
a doubt, that the Iron Mask was an Italian
of the name of Matthioli; a personage who
was first put on the list of candidates for that
honour, in a pamphlet published in 1801, by M.<a class="page" name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a>
Roux (Fazillac);<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="footnote-anchor">2</a> who, however, was then unable
to support his opinion with sufficient authorities.</p>

<p>Hercules Anthony Matthioli<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="footnote-anchor">3</a> was a Bolognese
of ancient family, distinguished in the law. He
was the son of Valerian Matthioli and Girolama
Maggi, and was born on the 1st of December 1640.
On the 13th of January, 1661, he married Camilla,
daughter of Bernard Paleotti, and widow of
Alexander Piatesi. By her he had two sons, one
of whom only had posterity, which has long since
been extinct. Early in life he was public reader
in the University of Bologna, but he soon quitted
his native city to enter into the service of Charles
the Third, Duke of Mantua, by whom he was
much favoured, and towards the conclusion of<a class="page" name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a>
whose reign he was made Secretary of State. His
successor, Ferdinand, Charles the Fourth, the last
sovereign of Mantua, of the house of Gonzaga,
created Matthioli Supernumerary Senator of Mantua,
an honour which had formerly been enjoyed
by his great grandfather, and gave him the title
of Count. When he ceased to be Secretary of
State at Mantua does not appear; but he was
clearly not in that office when he first, unhappily
for himself, was involved in diplomatic relations
with the agents of the French Government.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1677, the Abbé
d&#8217;Estrades,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="footnote-anchor">4</a> ambassador from France to the Republic
of Venice, conceived the idea, which he was
well aware would be highly acceptable to the insatiable
ambition of his master, of inducing the<a class="page" name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a>
Duke of Mantua<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="footnote-anchor">5</a> to allow of the introduction of
a French garrison into Casale,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="footnote-anchor">6</a> a strongly fortified
town, the capital of the Montferrat, and in a great
measure the key of Italy. The cession of the
fortress of Pignerol<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="footnote-anchor">7</a> to the French, by Victor
Amadeus,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="footnote-anchor">8</a> Duke of Savoy, in 1632, had opened<a class="page" name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a>
to them the entry of Piedmont, and the possession
of Casale would enable them to invade the Milanese,
whenever they were so inclined.</p>

<p>At this time the council of the Duke of Mantua,
headed by his mother,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="footnote-anchor">9</a> an Austrian Archduchess,
was entirely in the interests of the Court of Spain;
while the young Duke, plunged in pleasures and
excesses of every kind, took little apparent interest
in politicks. The great difficulty, therefore, which
Estrades had to encounter in the prosecution of this
intrigue, was the establishment of a channel of
communication with the Duke; who, as has been
stated, was surrounded by persons in the Spanish
interest. If he could once enter into secret relations
with that Prince, he hoped to be able to
bribe him into a concurrence in his designs; for
Ferdinand Charles was both needy and unprin<a class="page" name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a>cipled.
He had, besides, discovered, as he writes
word to Lewis, in his first letter<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="footnote-anchor">10</a> to him, dated
Venice, Dec. 18th, 1677, that the Duke was not so
abandoned to his pleasures, but that he still had
some ambition, and much chagrin at the state of
subjection in which he was kept by his mother;
joined to a great distrust of the Spaniards, who
were supposed to foment the divisions of the Court
of Mantua, with the view of, eventually, themselves
obtaining possession of Casale and the rest
of the Montferrat.</p>

<p>The desired channel of communication Estrades
thought he had found in Matthioli, who was a
complete master of Italian politicks, as well as
much in the Duke&#8217;s good graces. Before, however,
he proceeded to enlist him in his service, he
deemed it necessary to discover what was the bent
of his inclinations. This he effected ingeniously
enough, by sending a certain Giuliani, in whom
he appears to have placed implicit confidence, to
Verona, where Matthioli then was, to act as a spy<a class="page" name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a>
upon him. The report of Giuliani, upon his return
to Venice, was so favourable, both with regard
to the discontent of Matthioli against the Spaniards,
&#8220;who had always amused him with hopes,
and afterwards abandoned him,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="footnote-anchor">11</a> and his wish to
enter into the service of the French Monarch, that
Estrades lost no time in sending him (Giuliani)
back again for the purpose of conferring with Matthioli
upon the subject of the proposed negociation.</p>

<p>Giuliani was instructed by the Ambassador to
enlarge to Matthioli upon the jeopardy which the
sovereignty of the Duke of Mantua was in, in
consequence of the different pretensions of various
branches of his family to his territories, which
were more or less countenanced by the Spaniards
for the purposes of their own aggrandizement.
These were, among others, those of the Empress
Eleanor<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="footnote-anchor">12</a> to the Montferrat; and those of the<a class="page" name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a>
Marquis of Laguna<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="footnote-anchor">13</a> to the Duchy of Guastalla,
to the prejudice of the Duke of Mantua, who was
the rightful heir. Giuliani was also to lament
the dependant state of the Duke of Mantua, the
revenues of whose states, as well as all the powers
of government, were entirely in the hands of his
mother, and the Monk Bulgarini;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="footnote-anchor">14</a> and to explain
the necessity which, on these accounts, existed
for that Prince to seek, without delay, the alliance
and protection of Lewis the Fourteenth. He was
to assure him, in conclusion, that Estrades had no
doubt of the readiness of Lewis to assist in freeing<a class="page" name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a>
the Duke of Mantua from his embarrassments;
but that, in order to enable him to do this effectually,
it was absolutely necessary to garrison
Casale with French troops.</p>

<p>Matthioli concurred entirely in these views of
Giuliani, and offered to sound the Duke of Mantua
upon the subject. A few days afterwards, he sent
word to Estrades, that he had managed to have
an interview with that Prince (having previously
established himself secretly in the neighbourhood
of Mantua), and had found him generally well-disposed
to the plan. He also requested Estrades
to send Giuliani again to him, in order that they
might act in concert; the said Giuliani being also
a person who might, without suspicion, carry intelligence
backwards and forwards,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="footnote-anchor">15</a> which was not
the case with Matthioli himself.</p>

<p>Giuliani was accordingly sent, and had an audi<a class="page" name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a>ence
of the Duke of Mantua, who received him
very favourably, and acquainted him with his
willingness to enter into an alliance with France,
and to deliver up Casale, upon the understanding
that Estrades was to try to obtain for him
any reasonable requests he might make; the
principal of these, in addition to the grant of a
sum of money, was the being made generalissimo
of any French army that might be sent into
Italy, &#8220;that being,&#8221; says Estrades, &#8220;what he
wishes beyond all things; or rather, that being
the only thing he is very anxious for, in order
that he may have the same consideration in Italy
the late Duke of Modena<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="footnote-anchor">16</a> had, and the late
Duke of Mantua,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="footnote-anchor">17</a> who at his age commanded in<a class="page" name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a>
chief the Emperor&#8217;s army, with the title of Vicar
General of the Empire.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="footnote-anchor">18</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Mantua also announced in this
conference, that he put himself, on this occasion,
entirely into the hands of Matthioli, whom he
promised to reinstate in his place of Secretary
of State, and to appoint his first minister, as
soon as he himself should have regained his authority,
and that the treaty, he was now projecting
with the King of France, had been duly
executed.</p>

<p>To Matthioli were joined in the negociation
the two counsellors of the Duke of Mantua, in
whom he had the most confidence; the Marquis
Cavriani and Joseph Varano; and these, together<a class="page" name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a>
with Giuliani, Estrades, Pinchesne the French
Secretary of Embassy at Venice, and the Duke
himself, were the only persons in Italy acquainted
with the business; so that the Ambassador
had certainly very fair grounds for expressing his
hopes &#8220;the secrecy, so necessary in this affair,
would remain impenetrable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="footnote-anchor">19</a></p>

<p>This conference was followed by another, in
which the Duke showed the greatest impatience
to conclude the treaty; entreating that Lewis
might be instantly made acquainted with the
state it was at present in, and requesting, or
rather imploring, for a French army; on the arrival
of which he hinted much might be done
against the Duchy of Milan. Finally, he promised
to have a conference with Estrades, &#8220;as
he was soon going to Venice, where they might
see one another conveniently, and without being
observed, on account of the Carnival, during
which all the world, even the Doge and the<a class="page" name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a>
oldest Senators were accustomed to go about in
mask.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="footnote-anchor">20</a></p>

<p>He also requested that the Cardinal d&#8217;Estrées<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="footnote-anchor">21</a>
might not be made a party to the negociation; because
he was so well known to be employed generally
by Lewis to negociate with the Italian Sovereigns,
that his entering into it would naturally
excite the suspicions of the Spaniards that something
secret was going on; and that they would
then ruin him, the Duke of Mantua, before he
could receive the assistance of the French Monarch;
and that thus the hopes of both the con<a class="page" name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a>tracting
parties, from the treaty at present under
discussion, would be frustrated. To this proposition
Estrades agreed, though unwillingly. We
cannot but here remark how skilful a negociator
he seems to have been; beginning as he does by
making trial of his tools, and then of his arguments,
and afterwards bringing both of them to
bear very judiciously on the negociation, in the
way the most likely to lead to a favourable result.</p>

<p>When the affair was advanced thus far, Estrades
lost no time in forwarding an account of it to
Lewis, to whom, as he says himself, he had not
before ventured to write upon the subject, because
at first he despaired of being able to bring the intrigue
to bear: but he now thought it in so good
a train, that upon receiving the approval of his
proceedings from Lewis, he could almost answer
for its success. The letter of Estrades was accompanied
by a schedule, containing the demands of the
Duke of Mantua, and by a letter from Matthioli,
also addressed to Lewis, in which he offers to devote
himself to his service, to strive to detach his<a class="page" name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a>
master, the Duke of Mantua, from the Austrian interest,
and insinuates very plainly his wish and intention
of selling him and his fortress of Casale to
the French Monarch; whom, he says, he &#8220;regards
and reveres as a <i>Demigod</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="footnote-anchor">22</a> To these protestations
Lewis returned, as was natural, a very civil
answer;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="footnote-anchor">23</a> generally promising his protection and
favour to Matthioli.</p>

<p>On the 24th of December of the same year,
Estrades<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="footnote-anchor">24</a> writes to M. de Pomponne,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="footnote-anchor">25</a> (then
one of the Secretaries of State), to inform him
of a discovery he has made from the Duke of
Mantua himself, that the Austrian party have<a class="page" name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a>
determined, in case any French troops should
arrive in Italy, and that the Duke of Mantua
should manifest any disposition of favouring them,
to seize upon Casale and Mantua. He therefore
adds that the Duke, though thoroughly well-disposed
towards the French interests, cannot take
any active part in their favour, unless Lewis will
send into Italy a sufficient force to secure Casale
and the rest of the Duke&#8217;s territories from the attempts
of the House of Austria. He subsequently
seems to hint his fear that the life of the Duke
of Mantua may be made away with by the Austrians,
in order the more easily to possess themselves
of his territories. &#8220;We must besides, Sir,
consider that the Duke of Guastalla<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="footnote-anchor">26</a> being the
nearest relation of the Duke of Mantua, as well
as his heir, there would be danger that, if the<a class="page" name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a>
Duchess,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="footnote-anchor">27</a> his daughter, who is very ill and has
no children, should die, some <i>misfortune</i> might
happen to the Duke of Mantua, which would assure
his territories to the Spanish Nobleman, who
has married the second daughter<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="footnote-anchor">28</a> of the Duke of
Guastalla, and whose marriage the Spaniards,
<i>doubtless with this view</i>, made up at Vienna by
means of Don Vincent.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="footnote-anchor">29</a></p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></p>

<p>To Estrades, Lewis returned a long and detailed
statement of his views; in which he approves
generally of the design of putting a French garrison
into Casale; intimates upon what terms it may
be done; rejects a request of the Duke of Mantua
to procure for him the restoration of those
parts of the Montferrat, which by former treaties
had been ceded to the Duke of Savoy; objects to
the largeness of his demand of 100,000 pistoles as
the price of Casale; promises to bear him harmless
and remunerate him for any injury that may
be done to him by the Spaniards, in consequence
of his siding with the French; and finally instructs
Estrades, to entertain the notion that a French<a class="page" name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a>
army is about to pass the Alps, and in the meanwhile
to protract the negociation, in order to allow
him, Lewis, time to make his various preparations.
Indeed this last point, the necessity for delay, was
so strongly impressed upon Estrades, upon more
than one occasion, that, in a subsequent despatch,
he expresses his regret that the negociation goes
on so smoothly and prosperously, that he cannot
find any difficulties<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="footnote-anchor">30</a> to enable him to protract it
till the troops of Lewis are in readiness to march
towards Italy.</p>

<p>The only point in dispute appears to have been,
what the sum of money should be which was to
be given by the French Monarch to the Duke of
Mantua. The stipulation for 100,000 pistoles was
decidedly rejected by Lewis; and at length, after
some difficulty, Estrades reduced the demand of
the other party to 100,000 crowns, and those not
to be paid till after the signature of the treaty between
the two sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="footnote-anchor">31</a><a class="page" name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></p>

<p>The next event of importance in the negociation
was the interview, effected at Venice during the
Carnival, between the Duke of Mantua and Estrades.
It took place at midnight, on the 18th of
March, 1678, in a small open space, equally distant
from the residence of the Duke and the Ambassador,
and lasted a full hour. In it the Duke
dwelt<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="footnote-anchor">32</a> much upon his impatience for the conclusion
of the treaty with France; and for the speedy
appearance of the troops of the latter in Italy, alleging
as his reason, the constant and lively fear
he was in of the Spaniards. He also announced
his intention of sending Matthioli, in whom, says
Estrades, &#8220;He has a blind confidence, and who
governs him absolutely,&#8221; to the French court;
thinking that his presence there might bring matters
to a speedier issue.</p>

<p>Estrades, who had now ascertained that his master
could not possibly spare an army for Italy that
year (1678), and who therefore was more than ever<a class="page" name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a>
anxious to prevent such a consummation, consented
with considerable difficulty to the project; resolving,
at the same time, to obstruct the departure
of Matthioli for France as long as possible; and
writing to M. de Pomponne to delay him and his
business, when at length he arrived there, by every
means in his power.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="footnote-anchor">33</a></p>

<p>Subsequently the procrastinating intentions of
Estrades were more easily put into execution than
he expected; for Matthioli, of his own accord, deferred
his journey from spring to autumn on various
pleas, of which the principal one was, his unwillingness
to leave his master, exposed to the insinuations,
and perhaps menaces, of the Spanish
partizans, by whom he was surrounded.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="footnote-anchor">34</a></p>

<p>Finally, after many delays, Matthioli, accompanied
by Giuliani, set off for Paris in the beginning
of November, 1678, and arrived there towards the
end of the same month.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="footnote-anchor">35</a> He found the Abbé
d&#8217;Estrades, who had quitted his Venetian Em<a class="page" name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a>bassy,
arrived there before him, and had several
interviews with him and M. de Pomponne; during
which a treaty was agreed on to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the Duke of Mantua should receive the
French troops into Casale.</p>

<p>2. That if Lewis sent an army into Italy, the
Duke of Mantua should have the command of it.</p>

<p>3. That immediately after the execution of the
treaty, the sum of 100,000 crowns should be paid
to the Duke of Mantua.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="footnote-anchor">36</a></p>

<p>The treaty contained also some other articles of
minor importance.</p>

<p>Matthioli himself had the honour of being received
in a secret audience by Lewis,<a name="FNanchor_37a" id="FNanchor_37a"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="footnote-anchor">37</a> who made
him a present of a valuable ring.<a name="FNanchor_37b" id="FNanchor_37b"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="footnote-anchor">37</a> He also received
a sum of money for himself,<a name="FNanchor_37c" id="FNanchor_37c"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="footnote-anchor">37</a> and a promise<a class="page" name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a>
of a much larger gratification<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="footnote-anchor">38</a> after the ratification
of the treaty. He was also promised that his
son should be made one of the King&#8217;s Pages; and
that his brother, who was in the Church, should
receive a good benefice.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="footnote-anchor">39</a> He was then sent back
to Italy, with a detailed instruction from Louvois,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="footnote-anchor">40</a>
upon the manner of executing the articles of the
treaty.</p>

<p>The French Government was thus far so en<a class="page" name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a>tirely
satisfied of the sincerity and good faith of
Matthioli, and so convinced of the speedy admission
of the French troops into Casale, that they
immediately upon his departure took decided measures
in furtherance of their plan.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="footnote-anchor">41</a> Thus the Marquis
de Boufflers,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="footnote-anchor">42</a> Colonel-General of the Dragoons,
was sent to take the command of the forces,
which were assembling near the frontier of Italy,
at Briançon, in Dauphiny. Catinat,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="footnote-anchor">43</a> Brigadier
of Infantry, afterwards the celebrated Marshal of
that name, who was to serve under the command
of Boufflers, had orders to conceal himself in the
fortress of Pignerol,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="footnote-anchor">44</a> and to adopt a feigned name,<a class="page" name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a>
that of Richemont;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="footnote-anchor">45</a> while the Baron d&#8217;Asfeld,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="footnote-anchor">46</a>
Colonel of Dragoons, was despatched to Venice,
upon a mission for exchanging the ratifications of
the treaty; for which purpose he was to unite with
M. de Pinchesne, the Chargé d&#8217;Affaires there, during
the absence of an ambassador.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="footnote-anchor">47</a><a class="page" name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></p>

<p>Though these measures were taken with the
greatest secrecy, it was impossible but that the
report of the assembling of the French forces so
near the territories of the Duke of Savoy,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="footnote-anchor">48</a> should
reach the ears of the Spaniards, and excite their
suspicions; as well as those of the Venetians, and
of the other Italian states. Accordingly, we find
that remonstrances were several times made by the
ambassadors of the Emperor<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="footnote-anchor">49</a> and King of Spain<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="footnote-anchor">50</a>
at Venice, to the Duke of Mantua, upon the rumour
of his intention of delivering the capital of the<a class="page" name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a>
Montferrat to Lewis. Ferdinand Charles denied
that this was the case;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="footnote-anchor">51</a> but was not believed.</p>

<p>As, therefore, the ferment and discontent in the
north of Italy increased, the agents of the French
Government were naturally anxious that the treaty
should be ratified and executed as soon as possible;
for which purpose, the Duke of Mantua had promised
to meet the Baron d&#8217;Asfeld at Casale, during
the month of February, 1679. In proportion,
however, as the French became more impatient for
the conclusion of the affair, the Count Matthioli
found fresh excuses for delaying it. At one moment
his own ill health detained him at Padua, and prevented
his coming to Venice to confer with Messrs.
de Pinchesne and d&#8217;Asfeld; at another, the Duke
of Mantua could not raise a sufficient sum of
money to enable him to transport his court to
Casale; at another, it was necessary to have time
to persuade Don Vincent Gonzaga<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="footnote-anchor">52</a> to accompany
the Duke to Casale, as it was not considered safe<a class="page" name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a>
to leave him at Mantua; and again, the Duke of
Mantua was obliged to stay at Venice, having
promised to hold a carrousel there.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="footnote-anchor">53</a></p>

<p>In spite of all these difficulties, it was, however,
finally arranged, that the Baron d&#8217;Asfeld and
Matthioli should meet, on the 9th of March, at
Incréa, a village ten miles from Casale, in order to
make the exchange of the ratifications; that the
Duke of Mantua himself, should go to Casale on
the 15th of the same month; and should put the
troops of Lewis into possession of the place on the
18th; on which day, being the ninth after the
ratification, it was decided they could without fail
be there.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="footnote-anchor">54</a></p>

<p>The various excuses made by Matthioli, for the
non-execution of his agreement, all more or less
frivolous, appear first to have given to the French
Government a suspicion of his fidelity. Whether
the reception of Matthioli at the French court had
not been such as he expected, though it would<a class="page" name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a>
appear to have been most gracious; or whether,
which is more probable, the sum of money there
given to him did not content him;&mdash;or whether,
which is also probable, the Spaniards having got
some knowledge of the transaction, had offered him
a still larger bribe, it is impossible for us, at this
distance of time, exactly to decide; but it appears
evident, that, from the time of his return from
Paris, his conduct with regard to the negociation
became entirely changed; and he was as anxious to
procrastinate, as he had formerly been to advance
it. It was, therefore, natural for the French diplomatists
to conclude, supported as this opinion
also was by various circumstantial evidence, that
he had been bought by the other side&mdash;a circumstance
of no extraordinary occurrence in the career
of a needy Italian adventurer.</p>

<p>His weak and timid master followed implicitly
his counsels; but appears to have been himself in
the intention of acting fairly and faithfully by the
French Government. The first intimation that is
given in the correspondence of the suspicions, with<a class="page" name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a>
regard to the conduct of Matthioli, occurs in a
letter from Pomponne<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="footnote-anchor">55</a> to Matthioli himself, dated
February 21st, 1679, in which he says that Lewis
&#8220;is unwilling to doubt that the promise which has
been so solemnly made<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="footnote-anchor">56</a> him will not be kept;&#8221; an
expression which certainly seems to imply, that
some doubt did exist in the mind of Lewis and of
his ministers upon the subject.</p>

<p>The next is an elaborate and skilful letter of
Estrades to Matthioli, written on the 24th of
March, 1679,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="footnote-anchor">57</a> from Turin, where he was then
awaiting the execution of the treaty, in which he
mingles promises and threats to encourage him
to perform his stipulations; and shows sufficiently
his suspicions to the object of them, to frighten
him; at the same time leaving open the hope of
forgiveness in case of future good conduct.</p>

<p>By the subsequent letters<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="footnote-anchor">58</a> of Pomponne to<a class="page" name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a>
Pinchesne, it appears, that the treachery of Matthioli
soon became more apparent. Indeed, Estrades,
during his stay at Turin, obtained the most
indubitable evidence of the fact; for the Duchess
of Savoy<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="footnote-anchor">59</a> showed to him the copies of all the documents
relative to the negociation respecting
Casale, which Matthioli had given to the President
Turki, one of her ministers who was in the interests
of Spain, when he passed through Turin on
his return from Paris.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="footnote-anchor">60</a> From Turki, as it subsequently
appeared, Matthioli had received a sum of
money for his information.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="footnote-anchor">61</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Asfeld was arrested by the orders
of the Count de Melgar, the Spanish Governor of
the Milanese, as he was on his way to the rendez<a class="page" name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a>vous
at Incréa; and Matthioli was the first person
who acquainted the French agents with this misfortune,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="footnote-anchor">62</a>
as well as with the fact that the Duke of
Mantua had been obliged to conclude a treaty
with the Venetians, in a directly contrary sense to
the one he had first entered into with France;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="footnote-anchor">63</a>
&#8220;having probably been,&#8221; as Pomponne remarks,
in a letter to Pinchesne,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="footnote-anchor">64</a> &#8220;himself the sole author
of the accidents and impediments he acquaints us
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the intelligence at Paris, of
the arrest of Asfeld, the French ministers, though
their suspicions of Matthioli were now changed
into certainties, being still anxious, if possible, to
get possession of Casale, empowered Catinat to
supply his place, and to conclude the ratification of
the treaty. Intelligence of this change was conveyed
to Matthioli in a letter<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="footnote-anchor">65</a> from Pomponne, of
the date of March 14th, 1679.</p>

<p>Catinat accordingly went, on the appointed day,<a class="page" name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a>
from Pignerol to Incréa, accompanied by St. Mara,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="footnote-anchor">66</a>
the Commandant of that part of the fortress of
Pignerol, which was appropriated for a state prison,
and by a person of confidence, belonging to the embassy
of Estrades. But the appointed day passed
over, without bringing Matthioli to Incréa; and
the next morning Catinat was informed that his
arrival there was discovered; that the peasants of
the neighbourhood were in arms; and that a detachment
of cavalry was on its way, for the purpose
of seizing upon him and his companions. What
became of the latter does not appear, except that
they escaped the threatened danger; but he himself
got away secretly, and in disguise, to Casale;
where he gave himself out as an officer of the gar<a class="page" name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a>rison
of Pignerol. The Governor there, who was
well-disposed to the French interest, received him
with great civility; and, at a dinner he gave to him,
joined in drinking the King of France&#8217;s health with
enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="footnote-anchor">67</a> The next day Catinat was too happy
to return undiscovered to Pignerol.</p>

<p>Matthioli, meanwhile, instead of keeping his engagement
at Incréa, had returned to Venice, and
had had several interviews with Pinchesne, the
particulars of which we are unacquainted with,
as the letters containing the accounts of them,
though alluded to by M. de Pomponne<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="footnote-anchor">68</a> in his
answers, have not been published.</p>

<p>Pinchesne was, at this time, convinced of the
perfidy of Matthioli, having, in addition to various
other suspicious circumstances, discovered
that he had been secretly at Milan for some days.
He, however, did not think it advisable entirely
to break with him; but advised him to go and
confer with Estrades, at Turin; representing to<a class="page" name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a>
him the danger to which he exposed himself if
this affair failed of success through his fault.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="footnote-anchor">69</a>
Matthioli followed the advice of Pinchesne to
his own ruin, and going to Turin, presented himself
forthwith to Estrades,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="footnote-anchor">70</a> to whom he offered
many insufficient excuses for his delay.</p>

<p>The vindictive Lewis had, meanwhile, determined
to satisfy his wounded pride and frustrated
ambition, by taking the most signal vengeance of
Matthioli; as we find by the following note from
Louvois to his creature, St. Mars, dated, St. Germain,
April 27th, 1679.&mdash;&#8220;The King has sent
orders to the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, to try and arrest
a man, with whose conduct his Majesty has reason
to be dissatisfied; of which he has commanded
me to acquaint you, in order that you may not
object to receiving him when he shall be sent to
you; and that you may guard him in a manner,
that not only he may not have communication with
any one, but that also he may have cause to re<a class="page" name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a>pent
of his bad conduct; and that it may not be
discovered that you have a new prisoner.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="footnote-anchor">71</a></p>

<p>Nothing therefore could be more opportune to
Estrades, than the arrival of Matthioli at Turin,
and accident soon enabled him to lay a successful
plan for executing the wishes of the French monarch.
The plan he is said to have communicated
to the Duchess of Savoy, who consented to the
arrest taking place, but objected to its happening
on her territories.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="footnote-anchor">72</a></p>

<p>Matthioli complained much of want of money,
occasioned by the expenses of his journies, and
the bribes he had been obliged to offer to the
Duke&#8217;s mistresses. Estrades took this opportunity
of forwarding his scheme, by telling him that
Catinat, who, under the name of Richemont, commanded
the troops destined to take possession of
Casale, had considerable sums at his disposal,
which he would be happy to make so good a use
of as in ministering to his wants; provided he,
Matthioli, would give him a meeting on the fron<a class="page" name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a>tier
towards Pignerol, at which also Estrades
would be present.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="footnote-anchor">73</a> Of course, the reason assigned
for naming the frontier as the place of
rendezvous was, that Catinat could not leave the
neighbourhood where his troops were stationed.</p>

<p>To this proposition Matthioli readily consented;
and having first made a journey to Casale,
he returned and met Estrades (who was accompanied
on this expedition by his relation the Abbé
de Montesquiou) by appointment, in a church
half a mile from Turin, from whence they proceeded
together to the frontier. At three miles
from the place of rendezvous they were stopped
by a river, of which the banks were overflowed,
and the bridge broken. Matthioli himself assisted
in repairing the bridge, which was to convey
him to his captivity;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="footnote-anchor">74</a> and they then proceeded
on foot to the place where Catinat awaited them<a class="page" name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a>
accompanied only by two officers, the Chevaliers
de St. Martin and de Villebois, and by four soldiers
of the garrison of Pignerol.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="footnote-anchor">75</a></p>

<p>Before, however, Matthioli was arrested, Estrades
held some conversation with him, and obliged
him, in the presence of Catinat, to confess that
he had in his possession all the original papers
regarding the delivery of Casale, and that they
were left in the custody of his wife at Bologna;
who was living in the convent of the nuns of St.
Thomas<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="footnote-anchor">76</a> in that city. This was necessary, because
Matthioli had lately refused to give them
up to the Duke his master,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="footnote-anchor">77</a> alleging that he no
longer knew where they were. His confession,
upon this occasion, afterwards turned out to be
false, and that the papers in question were concealed
in a wall at Padua.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="footnote-anchor">78</a></p>

<p>Immediately after this avowal had been extracted
from him, he was arrested; and offered
no resistance, though he always carried a sword<a class="page" name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a>
and pistols about his person. He was conducted
to Pignerol, where he arrived late at night.</p>

<p>Catinat, in his letter to Louvois, giving an account
of this seizure, which took place on the 2d
of May, 1679, dwells much upon the secrecy with
which it was effected, so that, says he, &#8220;no one
knows the name of the rascal, not even the officers
who assisted in arresting him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="footnote-anchor">79</a> And he concludes
by mentioning, that in order to perpetuate
the mystery in which his prisoner is enveloped,
he has given him the name of &#8220;Lestang,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;not a
soul here knowing who he is.&#8221; In the subsequent
correspondence of Louvois with Catinat and St.
Mars, he is very generally designated by that
name. At first, St. Mars carried his precaution
so far as to serve Matthioli himself, and not allow
any of the garrison to approach him; soon
afterwards his valet, who had been arrested by
the exertions of Estrades,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="footnote-anchor">80</a> was allowed to attend
upon him; and subsequently St. Mars appointed
those of his officers, in whom he had the most<a class="page" name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a>
confidence, to assist in guarding him. It may be
remembered that Louvois, in his letter to St.
Mars, which has been before quoted, orders that
the prisoner, who was to be brought to Pignerol,
&#8220;should have intercourse with no one;&#8221; and in
the subsequent letters from the same Minister,
difficulties are even made to his being permitted
to see either a physician or a confessor.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="footnote-anchor">81</a></p>

<p>These extraordinary precautions against discovery,
and the one which appears to have been
afterwards resorted to, of obliging him to wear a
mask, during his journeys, or when he saw any
one, are not wonderful, when we reflect upon the
violent breach of the law of nations, which had
been committed by his imprisonment. Matthioli,
at the time of his arrest, was actually the plenipotentiary<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="footnote-anchor">82</a>
of the Duke of Mantua, for concluding
a treaty with the King of France; and for
that very sovereign to kidnap him and confine
him in a dungeon was certainly one of the most<a class="page" name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a>
flagrant acts of violence that could be committed;
one which, if known, would have had the most
injurious effects upon the negociations of Lewis
with other sovereigns; nay, would probably have
indisposed other sovereigns from treating at all
with him. It is true the Duke of Mantua was a
prince insignificant both in power and character,
but, if in this way might was allowed to overcome
right, who could possibly tell whose turn
might be the next. Besides, it was important for
Lewis that the Duke of Mantua should also be
kept in good humour, the delivery of Casale not
having been effected; nor is it to be supposed
that he would have consented to give it up to
the French monarch within two years of this
period, had he had a suspicion of the way his
diplomatic agent and intended prime minister had
been treated. The same reasons for concealment
existed till the death of Matthioli, since that event
happened while both Lewis XIV. and the Duke
of Mantua were still alive, which accounts for<a class="page" name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a>
his confinement continuing to be always solitary
and always secret.</p>

<p>The arrest of Matthioli, certainly appears to
have been the effect of a vindictive feeling against
him in the breast of Lewis himself; for it is impossible
to imagine that any minister would have
ventured, of his own free-will, upon a step by
which so much was to be hazarded, and nothing,
in fact, was to be gained. The act is only to be
explained in this manner; that the monarch insisted
upon his revenge, which the ministers were obliged
to gratify; and, at the same time, in order to prevent
any ill consequences that might result from
it, determined upon burying the whole transaction
under the most impenetrable veil of mystery.</p>

<p>The confinement of Matthioli is decidedly one of
the deadliest stains that blot the character of Lewis
the Fourteenth: for, granting that Matthioli betrayed
the trust reposed in him by that monarch,
one single act of diplomatic treachery was surely
not sufficient to warrant the infliction of the most<a class="page" name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a>
horrible of all punishments,&mdash;of solitary confinement,
for four and twenty years, in a dungeon!&mdash;It
was, however, an act of cruel injustice that was
to be expected from the man, who, when the unhappy
Fouquet<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="footnote-anchor">83</a> was condemned by the tribunals of
his country to exile, himself changed his sentence
to that of perpetual imprisonment;&mdash;who, to please
his mistress, confined his former favourite, Lauzun,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="footnote-anchor">84</a>
for nine years in the fortress of Pignerol, and only
then released him in order, by that means, to<a class="page" name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a>
swindle Mademoiselle de Montpensier<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="footnote-anchor">85</a> out of her
fortune, in favour of his bastard, the Duke du
Maine;&mdash;who shut up so many other persons,
guilty only of imaginary crimes, in various prisons,
where they died of misery and ill-treatment;&mdash;who
revoked the Edict of Nantes;&mdash;ordered the
burning of the Palatinate;&mdash;persecuted the saints
of Port Royal;&mdash;and gloried in the Dragonades,
and the war of the Cevennes;&mdash;who, in short,
whether we regard him as a man or a sovereign,
was one of the most hardened, cruel, and tyrannical
characters transmitted to us in history. Providence
doubtless made use of him as a scourge befitting
the crimes of the age he lived in; and, in
this point of view, his existence was most useful.
Nor is his memory less so; which has been left to<a class="page" name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a>
us and to all posterity, as a mighty warning of
the effects, even in this world, of overweening ambition;
and as a melancholy example of the perversion
of a proud heart, which &#8220;gave not God
the glory,&#8221; and was therefore abandoned by the
Almighty to the effects of its own natural and
irretrievable wickedness.</p>

<p>After the arrest of Matthioli, he underwent several
interrogatories,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="footnote-anchor">86</a> in which, in spite of his numerous
prevarications, his treachery was still more
amply discovered. The examinations were all
sent to Louvois by Catinat, who, as soon as they
were concluded, left Pignerol, and returned to the
court.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="footnote-anchor">87</a></p>

<p>At first, Matthioli was, by the direction of Estrades,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="footnote-anchor">88</a>
well-treated in his prison; but this was
not by any means the intention of Lewis, and
accordingly, we find Louvois writing thus to St.
Mars. &#8220;It is not the intention of the King that
the Sieur de Lestang should be <i>well-treated</i>; nor<a class="page" name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a>
that, except the absolute necessaries of life, you
should give him any thing that may make him pass
his time agreeably.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="footnote-anchor">89</a> Again, in the same strain:
&#8220;I have nothing to add to what I have already
commanded you respecting the severity with which
the individual named Lestang must be treated.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="footnote-anchor">90</a>
And again; &#8220;You must keep the individual
named Lestang, in the severe confinement I enjoined
in my preceding letters, without allowing
him to see a physician, unless you know he is in
absolute want of one.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="footnote-anchor">91</a> These repeated injunctions
to the same effect are a proof, how much
importance the rancorous Lewis attached to his
victim&#8217;s being compelled to drink the bitter cup
of captivity to the very dregs.</p>

<p>The harshness and hopelessness of his prison
seem to have affected the intellects of Matthioli,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="footnote-anchor">92</a>
for after he had been nearly a year confined, St.
Mars acquaints Louvois, that &#8220;The Sieur de
Lestang complains, he is not treated as a man of<a class="page" name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a>
his quality, and the minister of a great prince
ought to be; notwithstanding which, I continue
to follow your commands most exactly upon this
subject, as well as on all others. I think he is
deranged by the way he talks to me, telling me he
converses every day with God and his angels;&mdash;that
they have told him of the death of the Duke
of Mantua, and of the Duke of Lorrain;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="footnote-anchor">93</a> and as
an additional proof of his madness, he says, that
he has the honour of being the near relation of the
King, to whom he wishes to write, to complain of<a class="page" name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a>
the way in which I treat him. I have not thought
it right to give him paper or ink for that purpose,
perceiving him not to be in his right senses.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="footnote-anchor">94</a></p>

<p>The unhappy prisoner, in his phrensy and despair,
sometimes used very violent language to his
keepers, and wrote abusive sentences with charcoal
on the walls of his prison; on which account
St. Mars ordered his lieutenant, Blainvilliers, to
threaten him with punishment, and even to show
him a cudgel, with which he was to be beaten, if he
did not behave better.</p>

<p>These menaces so far intimidated Matthioli,
that a few days afterwards, while Blainvilliers was
serving him at dinner, he, in order to propitiate
him, took a valuable ring from his finger and
offered it to him. Blainvilliers told him he could
accept nothing from a prisoner, but that he would
deliver it to St. Mars; which he accordingly did.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="footnote-anchor">95</a>
St. Mars estimates the ring at fifty or sixty pistoles:
and M. Delort conjectures it to have been the one<a class="page" name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a>
given to him by Lewis the Fourteenth, during his
stay at Paris. St. Mars inquires from Louvois<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="footnote-anchor">96</a>
what he is to do in consequence; and the latter
returns for answer, that he &#8220;must keep the ring,
which the Sieur Matthioli has given to the Sieur
de Blainvilliers, in order to restore it to him, if it
should ever happen that the King ordered him to
be set at liberty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="footnote-anchor">97</a></p>

<p>Matthioli apparently expressed a wish to confess
to a priest; and Louvois desires that he may
be only allowed to do so once in the year.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="footnote-anchor">98</a> It
appears that St. Mars had at this time in his custody
a Jacobin monk, with whose crime, as well
as name, we are unacquainted; but in the correspondence
of St. Mars and Louvois, he is designated
as &#8220;the Jacobin in the lower part of the
tower.&#8221; This man was mad; very possibly had
been made so, like Matthioli, by solitary confinement
and ill-usage. St. Mars advised the putting
Matthioli with him, in order to avoid the neces<a class="page" name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a>sity
of sending for a priest for each prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="footnote-anchor">99</a>
To this proposal Louvois returned the following
answer: &#8220;I have been made acquainted, by your
letter of the 7th of this month (August 1680),
with the proposal you make, to put the Sieur de
Lestang with the Jacobin, in order to avoid the
necessity of having two priests. The King approves
of your project, and you have only to execute
it when you please.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="footnote-anchor">100</a></p>

<p>St. Mars, in a letter of the 7th of September,
1680, thus details the results of the execution of
his plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you permitted me to put Matthioli with
the Jacobin in the lower part of the tower, the
aforesaid Matthioli was, for four or five days, in
the belief that the Jacobin was a man that I had
placed with him to watch his actions. Matthioli,
who is almost as mad as the Jacobin, walked about
with long strides, with his cloak over his nose,
crying out that he was not a dupe, but that he
knew more than he would say. The Jacobin,<a class="page" name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a>
who was always seated on his truckle bed, with
his elbows resting upon his knees, looked at him
gravely, without listening to him. The Signior
Matthioli remained always persuaded that it was
a spy that had been placed with him, till he was
one day disabused, by the Jacobin&#8217;s getting down
from his bed, stark naked, and setting himself
to preach, without rhyme or reason, till he was
tired. I and my lieutenants saw all their man&#339;uvres
through a hole over the door.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="footnote-anchor">101</a></p>

<p>It appears to have been very entertaining to St.
Mars and his lieutenants, to witness the ravings of
these two unhappy maniacs; and there are probably
many gaolers who would experience the same
feelings upon a similar occasion: what cannot,
however, but strike us with horror, is the fact
that there was found a minister, nay, a king, and
that king one who piqued himself upon professing
the Christian religion,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="footnote-anchor">102</a> to sanction such a<a class="page" name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a>
proceeding. It is indeed most painful to think,
that power should have been placed in the hands
of men, who could abuse it by such needless acts
of cruelty.</p>

<p>We have no farther particulars of the state of
Matthioli&#8217;s mind: but, being more than half-mad at
the time he was placed with the Jacobin, who was
quite so, it is probable the company of the latter
increased and perpetuated his phrensy. It is even
not impossible that such may have been the intention
of St. Mars, as, while Matthioli continued insane,
it was of course more reasonable and plau<a class="page" name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a>sible
to continue the extraordinary rigour of his
confinement.</p>

<p>Nor were mental sufferings the only ones which
the barbarity of Lewis and his minister obliged
Matthioli to undergo. We have before seen, from
the letters of Louvois to St. Mars, that the latter
was desired generally to treat Matthioli with great
severity; afterwards he writes to him upon the
subject of his clothing, &#8220;You must make the
clothes of such sort of people as he is last three
or four years.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="footnote-anchor">103</a> Some idea may also be formed
of the kind of furniture of his dungeon, from the
circumstance, mentioned by St. Mars, that, upon
the removal of his prisoner from the fort of Exiles
to the Island of St. Margaret in 1687, his bed had
been sold, because it was so old and broken as not
to be worth the carriage; and that all his furniture
and linen being added to it, the sum produced by
the sale was only thirteen crowns.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="footnote-anchor">104</a></p>

<p>It may be worth remarking here that the letter<a class="page" name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a>
of Louvois, respecting Matthioli&#8217;s clothes, is a sufficient
answer to the absurd stories with regard
to the richness of the lace, &amp;c. worn by the Iron
Mask; and the relations from St. Mars himself
of his threats to his prisoner, of even corporal punishment,
no less disprove the erroneous accounts
of the extraordinary respect shown to him.</p>

<p>In the year 1681, St. Mars was offered the government
of the citadel of Pignerol, which he declined
accepting, for what reasons we are not told:
Lewis, who was anxious to recompense his services
as a gaoler of State prisoners, then gave him the
government of Exiles,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="footnote-anchor">105</a> a strong fortress and pass
near Susa, on the frontier of Piedmont and the
Briançonnois, which was vacant by the death of the
Duke de Lesdiguières; at the same time augmenting
the salary attached to that situation, so as to
make it equal to that of the towns in Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="footnote-anchor">106</a>
Louvois, in a letter dated May 12th, 1681, ac<a class="page" name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a>quaints
St. Mars with his appointment; and informs
him that &#8220;the two prisoners in the lower
part of the tower&#8221; are the only ones of those under
his care at Pignerol, whom the King wishes to accompany
him to Exiles.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="footnote-anchor">107</a> &#8220;The two prisoners
in the lower part of the tower,&#8221; signify, as we
have before seen, Matthioli and the monk.</p>

<p>An additional proof indeed, if any were wanted,
that Matthioli was one of the two prisoners conveyed
to Exiles, is given in the following extract
from a letter of Louvois, dated June 9th, 1681:&mdash;&#8220;With
regard to the effects belonging to the
Sieur Matthioli which are in your possession,
you will have them taken to Exiles, in order to be
given back to him, if ever his Majesty should
order him to be set at liberty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="footnote-anchor">108</a></p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that this is the last time
Matthioli is mentioned by name in the correspondence
between Louvois and St. Mars&mdash;in consequence,
it appears, of what is said by the former in<a class="page" name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a>
his letter before quoted of the 12th of May,
where he desires a list of the names of all the prisoners
then under the guard of St. Mars to be
sent to him, and adds&mdash;&#8220;with regard to the two
who are in the lower part of the tower, you need
only designate them in that manner, without
adding any thing else.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="footnote-anchor">109</a> This precaution was
evidently enjoined lest the list should fall into
other hands, while it also shows that the necessity
for concealment was still considered as strong
as ever.</p>

<p>This is also proved by the precautions ordered
to be taken during the journey of the two
prisoners, lest they should be seen or spoken to
by any one; and by the repeated orders for their
strict confinement.&mdash;&#8220;The intention of his Majesty
is, that, as soon as the room at Exiles,
which you shall judge the most proper for the
secure keeping of the two prisoners in the lower
part of the tower, shall be in a state to receive<a class="page" name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a>
them, you should send them out of the citadel of
Pignerol in a litter, and conduct them there under
the escort of your troop.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="footnote-anchor">110</a> &#8220;His Majesty expects
that you will guard the two before-mentioned prisoners,
with the same exactitude you have made
use of hitherto.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="footnote-anchor">111</a> To these instructions St. Mars
returned an answer in the same strain, dated from
Pignerol, as he was on the point of setting off for
Exiles.&mdash;&#8220;In order that the prisoners may not be
seen (at Exiles), they will not leave their chamber
when they hear mass; and in order that they may
be kept the more securely, one of my lieutenants
will sleep above them, and there will be two sentinels
night and day, who will watch the whole
round of the tower, without its being possible for
them and the prisoners to see and to speak to one
another, or even to hear any thing of one another.
They will be the soldiers of my company,
who will be always the sentinels over the prisoners.
There is only a confessor, about whom I<a class="page" name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a>
have my doubts; but if you do not disapprove, I
will give them the curate of Exiles instead, who is
a good man, and very old; whom I will forbid, on
the part of his Majesty, to inquire who these prisoners
are, or their names, or what they have been,
or to speak of them in any way, or to receive from
them by word of mouth, or by writing, either communications
or notes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="footnote-anchor">112</a></p>

<p>Before St. Mars removed finally to Exiles, he
went there to inspect the fortress, leaving his prisoners
under the guard of one of his lieutenants;
which is here mentioned to show the falseness of
the idea that he never quitted his mysterious
prisoner. Louvois enjoined him before he left
them, to arrange the guarding of his prisoners in
such a manner, that no accident might happen to
them during his short absence; and &#8220;that they
might have no intercourse with any one, any more
than they had had during the time they had been
under his charge.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="footnote-anchor">113</a> Subsequently Louvois de<a class="page" name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a>sired
him not to be more than one night at a time
absent from Pignerol.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="footnote-anchor">114</a></p>

<p>St. Mars found certain repairs to be necessary
to that part of the fortress of Exiles, which he
deemed the most proper residence for &#8220;the two
prisoners in the lower part of the tower.&#8221; He
demanded money for this purpose, and Louvois
returned for answer that the King accorded him
a thousand crowns, on condition he kept the grant
a profound secret, and gave out that the repairs
he was making, were at his own expense.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="footnote-anchor">115</a> This
again was evidently for the purpose of concealing
from the neighbourhood, that any prisoners
of importance were to be removed from Pignerol
to Exiles.</p>

<p>The repairs of the tower at Exiles first delayed
the removal of St. Mars, and afterwards he was
ordered to stay some time longer at Pignerol, in
order to receive Catinat, who was again sent there
secretly, again under the assumed name of Riche<a class="page" name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a>mont,
and again for the purpose of taking possession
of Casale.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="footnote-anchor">116</a> This time the King of France was
more fortunate than he had been in 1679, as Casale
was actually sold to him by the Duke of Mantua,
in the autumn of this year, 1681.</p>

<p>Finally, it appears that St. Mars and his prisoners
did not move to Exiles till late in the
autumn of 1681. About this time, St. Mars apparently
requested permission to see and converse
with Matthioli occasionally, for Louvois
writes, &#8220;this word is only to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter. The King does not disapprove
of your visiting from time to time the
last prisoner who has been placed in your charge,
after he shall have been established in his new
prison, and shall have left that where he is at
present confined.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="footnote-anchor">117</a> It is rather curious to observe,
from this document, that St. Mars was
permitted to visit his prisoner at Exiles, but not
while he continued at Pignerol.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></p>

<p>The first communication of St. Mars to Louvois
after his arrival at Exiles, which has been published,
is dated December the 4th, 1681,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="footnote-anchor">118</a> and relates
to the sickness of his prisoners: and the next
is a letter, dated March 11th, 1682, containing
a similar detail to those already alluded to, of
the precautions he took for the security and solitary
confinement of his two prisoners. He begins,
by intimating that he has again received a
charge from Louvois to that effect, and that he
continues to guard his two prisoners as severely
and exactly as he has ever done, and as he did
formerly &#8220;Messrs. Fouquet and Lauzun, who
could not boast that they had either sent or received
any news, while they were in confinement.&#8221;
He adds, that the two prisoners can hear the people
who pass along the road at the foot of their prison,
but that they cannot be heard by any one; that,
in the same way, they can see the people who
are on the hill opposite their windows, but cannot<a class="page" name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a>
themselves be seen, on account of the bars
placed across their room; that there are two
sentinels always watching them, and who have
also orders to prevent the passengers stopping
under their windows&mdash;and that his own room,
being joined to the tower, and commanding a
view of the sentinels, the latter are by this means
always kept alert. That, in the inside of the
tower, he has made a partition, which prevents
the priest, who says mass, from seeing the prisoners,
as well as the servants who bring their
food&mdash;which is afterwards carried in to them by
his lieutenant; who, together with himself, the
confessor, and a physician from Pragelas, a town
six leagues distant, are the only persons who
speak to them; the physician only being allowed
to do so in the presence of St. Mars himself. He
adds, that equal precautions are taken with regard
to their linen, and other necessaries.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="footnote-anchor">119</a></p>

<p>From this period, we hear no more of St. Mars
and his prisoners in the published documents, for<a class="page" name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a>
above three years; his next communication to
Louvois being dated Dec. 23d, 1685; in which he
informs him that his prisoners are still ill, and in
a course of medicine. By the expression <i>still</i>
being here used, it would seem as if their malady
had been of considerable duration. He continues,
&#8220;they are, however, perfectly tranquil.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="footnote-anchor">120</a> The
mention of their present tranquillity is certainly
an indication that their insanity had continued,
at least at intervals.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the Jacobin<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="footnote-anchor">121</a> died. Matthioli
continued ill; and St. Mars, also finding his
own health failing him, he<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="footnote-anchor">122</a> became convinced that
the air of Exiles was unwholesome, and petitioned
in consequence for a change of government.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="footnote-anchor">123</a> Lewis
upon this appointed him, in 1687, to that of the
Islands of St. Margaret and St. Honorat, on the
coast of Provence, near Antibes, and ordered him,
as before, to take Matthioli with him.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></p>

<p>As in the case of his removal to Exiles, so, upon
the present occasion, St. Mars went first to look at
and prepare the prison at St. Margaret, before he
conveyed his prisoner there.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="footnote-anchor">124</a> Previously, however,
to leaving him for that purpose, he writes
to Louvois, to assure him once more of the secrecy
and security with which he is confined&mdash;&#8220;I
have given such good orders for the guarding
of my prisoner, that I can answer for his entire
security; as well as for his not now, nor ever, holding
any intercourse with my Lieutenant, whom I
have forbidden to speak to him, which is punctually
obeyed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="footnote-anchor">125</a></p>

<p>He afterwards writes again to the same Minister,
from the Island of St. Margaret, &#8220;I promise to
conduct my prisoner here in all security, without
any one&#8217;s seeing or speaking to him. He shall not
hear mass after he leaves Exiles, till he is lodged
in the prison which is preparing for him here, to<a class="page" name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a>
which a chapel is attached. I pledge my honour
to you for the entire security of my prisoner.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="footnote-anchor">126</a></p>

<p>St. Mars accordingly returned for Matthioli,
and conveyed him to his new abode, in the manner
he had proposed doing, in his letter to Louvois,
of January 20th, 1687&mdash;&#8220;In a chair, covered
with oil-cloth, into which there would enter
a sufficiency of air, without its being possible for
any one to see or speak to him during the journey,
not even the soldiers, whom I shall select to be
near the chair.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="footnote-anchor">127</a></p>

<p>In spite of the expectations of St. Mars that, in
this mode of conveyance, his prisoner would have
air enough, it appears that he complained of the
want of it, and soon fell ill in consequence. This
is mentioned in a letter of St. Mars, dated May
3d, 1687, giving an account of their arrival at
the Island of St. Margaret, and is the last of the
correspondence between Louvois and St. Mars<a class="page" name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a>
respecting Matthioli: &#8220;I arrived here the 30th of
last month. I was only twelve days on the journey,
in consequence of the illness of my prisoner,
occasioned, as he said, by not having as much
air as he wished. I can assure you that no one
has seen him, and that the manner in which I
have guarded and conducted him during all the
journey, makes every body try to conjecture who
my prisoner is.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="footnote-anchor">128</a></p>

<p>It was probably, during this journey, that St.
Mars first made use of a mask to hide the features
of Matthioli.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="footnote-anchor">129</a> Not as has been erroneously
supposed a mask made of iron, which it will be
evident, upon the slightest reflection, could not
have been borne upon the face for any long continuance
of time, but one of black velvet,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="footnote-anchor">130</a> strengthened
with whalebone, and fastened behind the
head with a padlock, which did not prevent the<a class="page" name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a>
prisoner from eating and drinking, or impede his
respiration.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="footnote-anchor">131</a></p>

<p>The identity of Matthioli with the prisoner
known by the name of &#8220;the Iron Mask,&#8221; is here
very satisfactorily confirmed by circumstantial
evidence. We have seen that Matthioli and the
Jacobin were placed together at Pignerol; we
have seen that they were designated as &#8220;the two
prisoners in the lower part of the tower;&#8221; we
have seen that &#8220;the two prisoners in the lower
part of the tower&#8221; were the only ones who accompanied
St. Mars when his government was
transferred to Exiles; we have seen the death
of the Jacobin at the latter place; and now we
find St. Mars conveying a single prisoner, designated
as &#8220;<i>the prisoner</i>,&#8221; with him to St. Margaret,
with a repetition of the same precautions
and of the same secrecy as on former occasions,
to which are added the celebrated Mask. Who
could this prisoner be but Matthioli? It is also<a class="page" name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a>
observable, that in all the various accounts of
the Iron Mask, though the dates are made to
vary, he is always said to have been originally
confined at Pignerol, subsequently at the island
of St. Margaret, and finally to have accompanied
St. Mars to the Bastille.</p>

<p>The prison of Matthioli, at the Island of St.
Margaret, was a room lighted by a single window
to the north, pierced in a very thick wall, guarded
by bars of iron, and looking upon the sea.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="footnote-anchor">132</a> During
his residence in this place, his valet, who,
as may be remembered, had been arrested by
Estrades, and who had served his master ever since
his confinement, died, and was buried at midnight,
and with great secrecy. To supply his place, a
woman of the neighbourhood was asked if she
would undertake to wait upon the prisoner. At
first she consented to accept of the place, imagining<a class="page" name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a>
it might be a means of benefiting her family; but
afterwards declined it, upon learning that she was
to be cut off from all further intercourse with the
world, and never even to see her family again.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="footnote-anchor">133</a>
Whether any one was eventually found to undertake
the office, does not appear.</p>

<p>Among the erroneous anecdotes that have obtained
credence with regard to the Iron Mask,
there are two, or rather apparently two versions
of one event, which is said to have taken place
while he was at the island of St. Margaret, but
which is proved to be incorrect, by a letter published
by M. Roux (Fazillac).</p>

<p>One version of the story states, that the mysterious
prisoner wrote his name and qualities with the
point of a knife upon a silver plate, and threw it
out of his window; that it was picked up by a fisherman,
who could not read, but brought it to St.
Mars; and that the latter, having ascertained that<a class="page" name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a>
the man could not read, released him.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="footnote-anchor">134</a> The other
version is, that the prisoner covered one of his
shirts with writing, and then threw it out of
window; a Monk found it, brought it to the Governor,
and assured him he had not read it; but
was himself found dead in his bed two days afterwards,
and was supposed to have been assassinated.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="footnote-anchor">135</a>
The origin of these stories, is evidently
to be found in a letter from St. Mars to the
Minister,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="footnote-anchor">136</a> dated June 4th, 1692; in which he
informs him that he has been obliged to inflict
corporal punishment upon a Protestant minister,
named Salves, who was a prisoner under his care,
because <i>he would write things upon his pewter<a class="page" name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a>
vessels, and on his linen, in order to make known
that he was imprisoned unjustly, on account of the
purity of his faith</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="footnote-anchor">137</a> Thus we see that this anecdote,
which has been twisted into the history of the
Iron Mask, had, in fact, no relation to him. And
this circumstance should put us on our guard with
respect to the many other marvellous stories, which
have probably been pressed in the same way into
the service. It is also worthy of remark that the
public having determined that the Iron Mask was
a great Prince, every thing was related in a manner
to favour this opinion&mdash;and thus the pewter
of the obscure Salves was turned, in the anecdote,
into silver plate.</p>

<p>After eleven years&#8217; tedious confinement at the
Island of St. Margaret, Matthioli accompanied
St. Mars to the Bastille, to the government of
which the latter was appointed, upon the death
of M. de Bezemaux, which occurred in the last
days of 1697.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="footnote-anchor">138</a></p>

<p>Before his departure from St. Margaret, St.<a class="page" name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a>
Mars wrote to the Minister to request that secure
lodgings might be provided for him and his prisoner
during the journey; to which he received
for answer, &#8220;It will be sufficient that you should
lodge as conveniently and securely as you can, by
means of payment.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="footnote-anchor">139</a></p>

<p>St. Mars accordingly set forth on his journey to
the Bastille, early in the autumn of 1698, and in
the course of it lodged at his own estate of Palteau,
which he probably considered a securer resting
place for his prisoner than any inn could have
been. An account of his visit to Palteau has been
given by one of his descendants, of whose accuracy
no reasonable doubt can be entertained.</p>

<p>It is there stated, that the masked prisoner
arrived at Palteau in a litter, which preceded the<a class="page" name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a>
one in which St. Mars himself travelled. They
were accompanied by many men on horseback,
and by the peasants who had gone to meet their
landlord. St. Mars always ate with his prisoner,
and the latter sat with his back to the windows
of the dining-room, so that the peasants, who were
in the court, could not see whether he kept his
mask on while at meals; but they observed that
St. Mars, who sat opposite to him, had two pistols
placed by the side of his plate. They were served
by a single servant, who brought all the dishes
from the anti-room, where they were placed, and
always when he came in or went out shut the
door very carefully after him. When the prisoner
crossed the court, he always had his black mask
over his face. The peasants also observed, that
his teeth and lips were seen, that he was tall of
stature, and had grey hair. St. Mars slept in a
bed, which had been put up close to that of his
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="footnote-anchor">140</a><a class="page" name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></p>

<p>St. Mars and Matthioli arrived at the Bastille
on the 18th of September, 1698, and the former
immediately went to the Minister to apprize him
of their arrival.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="footnote-anchor">141</a> This event is thus commemorated
in the journal of M. Dujonca,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="footnote-anchor">142</a> who was for
many years the Lieutenant of the King, at the
Bastille:&mdash;&#8220;Thursday, 18th September, 1698, at
three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, M. de St. Mars,
Governor of the Bastille, arrived to take posses<a class="page" name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a>sion
of his office, coming from the Islands of St.
Margaret and St. Honorat, bringing with him
in his litter an old prisoner, whom he had under
his care at Pignerol, of whom the name is not
mentioned; who is always kept masked, and who
was first placed, till night, in the tower of the
Basiniere,<a name="FNanchor_143a" id="FNanchor_143a"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="footnote-anchor">143</a> and whom I conducted afterwards
myself, at nine o&#8217;clock at night, to the third
chamber of the tower of the Bertaudière;<a name="FNanchor_143b" id="FNanchor_143b"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="footnote-anchor">143</a> which
chamber I had taken care to furnish with all
things necessary before his arrival, having received
orders to that effect from M. de St. Mars.
When I conducted him to the before-mentioned
chamber, I was accompanied by the Sieur Rosarges,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="footnote-anchor">144</a>
whom M. de St. Mars also brought with
him, and who is charged to wait upon and take
care of the aforesaid prisoner, who is fed by the
Governor.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="footnote-anchor">145</a><a class="page" name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></p>

<p>Dujonca&#8217;s account is confirmed by the extracts
of the Register of the Bastille, published in the
work entitled &#8220;La Bastille dévoilée.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="footnote-anchor">146</a></p>

<p>The placing of the prisoner, on his first arrival,
temporarily in one part of the Bastille, and afterwards
removing him by night to another, appears
to have been done for the sake of greater secrecy;
and we see by this, as well as by the account of
his visit to Palteau, that the precautions against
the possibility of discovery of his name and character
were in no way diminished.</p>

<p>He certainly continued, from all accounts, to
wear his mask from the time of his arrival at the
Bastille till his death. We learn from the persons
who saw him at Palteau that he was tall of stature;
and an old physician, who had attended him at
the Bastille when he was ill, described him (if
we may credit Voltaire) as well made, of a brown
complexion, and possessing an agreeable voice.<a class="page" name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a>
He attended mass occasionally, and was forbid
in his way there to speak to any one. The invalids
were ordered to fire upon him if he disobeyed.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="footnote-anchor">147</a>
He is also said to have occupied himself a
good deal during his confinement with playing on
the guitar.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="footnote-anchor">148</a></p>

<p>These are all the particulars, worthy of credit,
to be collected respecting Matthioli during his confinement
at the Bastille, which lasted rather more
than five years. He died there after a few hours&#8217;
illness, November 19th, 1703. Dujonca&#8217;s journal
gives the following account of his decease and
interment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monday, 19th November, 1708. The unknown
prisoner, who was always masked with a
mask of black velvet, whom M. de St. Mars
brought with him, when he came from the Islands
of St Margaret, and whom he had had the care
of for a long time, having found himself rather
more unwell when he came out from mass, died<a class="page" name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a>
to-day, about ten o&#8217;clock in the evening, without
having had any considerable illness. M. Girault,
our chaplain, confessed him yesterday. Death
having come suddenly on, he was not able to receive
his sacraments, and our chaplain only had
time to exhort him for a moment before he died.
He was interred on Tuesday the 20th November,
at four in the afternoon, in the church-yard of
St. Paul, which is our parish. His interment cost
forty livres.&#8221;</p>

<p>This extract is confirmed in its facts by the register
of the Bastille,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="footnote-anchor">149</a> as well as by the register
of burials of the church of St. Paul, at Paris.
The former document also informs us that he was
wrapped in &#8220;a winding-sheet of new linen,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="footnote-anchor">150</a>&mdash;and
the latter, that he was buried in the presence
of Rosarges, Major of the Bastille, and of Reilh,
Surgeon-Major of the same prison.</p>

<p>In the register of the church he is designated
by the name of Marchialy, and his age is entered as<a class="page" name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a>
forty-five; assertions which are both of them evidently
incorrect, and probably only made in order
to mislead the curious. At the time of his death,
Matthioli was sixty-three years of age, as appears
from the date of his birth before given. Shortly before
he died, he told the Apothecary of the Bastille
that he believed he was sixty years<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="footnote-anchor">151</a> old&mdash;a degree
of inaccuracy as to his own age, which is easily to
be conceived in a man who had been so long and
so rigorously imprisoned. His confinement had
lasted above twenty-four years.</p>

<p>After the decease of Matthioli, every thing was
done to endeavour to destroy all trace even of his
former existence. His clothes were burnt, as was
all the furniture of his room; the silver plate, the
copper, and the pewter, which had been used by
him, were melted down; the walls of his chamber
were first scraped, and then fresh white-washed;
the floor was new paved; the old ceiling was taken
away and renewed; the doors and windows were<a class="page" name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a>
burnt; and every corner was searched in which it
was thought any paper, linen, or other memorial
of him might be concealed.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="footnote-anchor">152</a></p>

<p>Thus were continued, to the very last, the same
extraordinary precautions against discovery, which
marked the whole imprisonment of the mysterious
prisoner: a circumstance, which of itself certainly
affords a strong confirmation of the fact, that the
<i>Iron Mask of the Bastille</i>, was one and the same
person with the <i>Count Matthioli</i>, who had been so
secretly introduced into Pignerol, and so mysteriously
conveyed from place to place by St. Mars.
But the actual proof of this is only to be found in
the documents which form the groundwork of the
preceding narrative; and which, undoubtedly, do
present a most convincing and satisfactory chain of
evidence upon the subject.</p>

<p>An important corroboration of this evidence is
also derived from the well-attested fact, that Lewis<a class="page" name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a>
the Fifteenth, who is allowed, on all hands, to have
known the history of the Iron Mask, affirmed, more
than once, that <i>he was the minister of an Italian
sovereign</i>. He told the Duke de Choiseul,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="footnote-anchor">153</a> on
one occasion, that he knew who the Iron Mask
was; and, upon the Duke&#8217;s questioning him further,
would only add, <i>that all the conjectures hitherto
made upon the subject were erroneous</i>.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="footnote-anchor">154</a> The Duke<a class="page" name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a>
then begged Madame de Pompadour<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="footnote-anchor">156</a> to ask the
King who it was; she did so, and his reply was,
&#8220;<i>The minister of an Italian prince!</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="footnote-anchor">157</a> The Duke<a class="page" name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a>
de Choiseul, unsatisfied by this reply, which he
considered to be only an evasion, took another opportunity
of again applying to the King upon the
subject, who again answered, &#8220;<i>He believed that
the prisoner was a minister of one of the courts of
Italy!</i>&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="footnote-anchor">158</a></p>

<p>Thus has the ill-fated Matthioli been identified
with the Iron Mask, and traced through his long
and dreary prison to his grave. It is probable
that much of the illusion and interest, which accompanied
the mysterious appellation of <i>the Iron
Mask</i>, will be destroyed by the certainty of who
he really was; as well as by the comparative insignificance
of the personage who has successfully
laid claim to the title. Still it is surely satisfactory
that truth, after being so long overwhelmed
by error, should be at length triumphant.</p>

<span class="footnote-text">If we were to judge of the Christian religion by the
manner in which it was professed by Lewis the Fourteenth,
we should indeed have a most perverted idea of its precepts.
It seems as if the pseudo-christianity of that monarch,
only incited him to acts of narrow-minded bigotry
and cruelty, allowing, at the same time, full latitude to
every kind of licentious excess; while it debarred him from
the exercise of humanity and toleration. A good measure
of the nature and extent of his religious knowledge and
feelings is acquired, by the anecdote respecting Fontpertuis
and the Duke of Orleans. When the latter was going
into Spain, Lewis objected to his taking the former with
him, because he was a Jansenist; but withdrew the objection
when assured by the duke that he was only an atheist!</span></div>

ESTRADES TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Commencement of the Negociation.&mdash;State of the Court of
Mantua.&mdash;Influence of the Spaniards there.</p>

<p class="date">
Venice, Dec 18th, 1677.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>As the grief I felt at having displeased your
Majesty was extreme, so my joy is not less to
learn from M. de Pomponne, that your Majesty
has had the goodness to pardon me my too great
facility; and that you have been graciously pleased
to listen to the reasons, which I took the liberty
to offer to you, in justification of the innocence of
my intentions; however, Sire, this misfortune will<a class="page" name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a>
oblige me, in future, to act in all things with so
great a circumspection, that your Majesty will,
I hope, never have cause to be dissatisfied with my
conduct.</p>

<p>I have thus far deferred informing your Majesty
of a project, which my anxiety for your
service has suggested to me, because the success
of it appeared so difficult that I did not venture
to propose it, till I saw some chance of being able
to accomplish it; but, as the affair is at present in
a favourable state, I can almost assure your Majesty,
that the conclusion of it will depend upon
yourself. I shall now give you an exact account
of it, in order that I may receive the orders it
shall please you to send me; which I will take care
to execute punctually. About four months ago,
having become more particularly acquainted with
the divisions at the Court at Mantua than before
was the case, and having heard that the Duke of
Mantua was not so abandoned to his pleasures,
but that he still had some ambition, and much
chagrin at the state to which he was reduced by
his mother, and his suspicions of the Spaniards; I
hoped that it would not be impossible, to detach
him entirely from them, to induce him to enter<a class="page" name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a>
into the views of your Majesty, and to persuade
him really to treat respecting Casale. I have
thought that I could not employ any one in this
affair more proper to conduct it, than a certain
Count Matthioli, who is entirely devoted to that
prince; I had already known him for some time,
and he had testified a great desire of rendering
himself agreeable to your Majesty by some service.
I knew that he had been Secretary of State to
the late Duke of Mantua, that the present one had
preserved much affection for him, and that he
was well-informed of the different interests of the
Princes of Italy; but as he had been much in the
Milanese, and had had a good deal of access to the
Spanish ministers, I would not put any confidence
in him, till I had first tried him. I therefore
charged the individual, named Giuliani, to whom
your Majesty had the goodness to make six months
ago a gratification, and who has a zeal for your
service which prevents my having any doubt of his
fidelity, to observe Matthioli attentively and secretly;
and after I had been sufficiently informed
that he was much discontented with the Spaniards,
who had always amused him with hopes, and afterwards
abandoned him, I sent Giuliani, in the month<a class="page" name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a>
of last October, to Verona, where he went under
pretext of his private affairs; but in fact, to put
Matthioli, who was there, upon the subject of the
Duke of Mantua, according to the instruction I had
given him, and to represent to him that those who
had an attachment for their prince, could not but
be much afflicted to see him, at his age, still under
the guidance of his mother; without money, without
authority, always in a state of suspicion against
those who are habitually about him; and what is
worse, in so insensible a state, that he only thought
of passing his life with actresses and women of
the town; which had made him lose the esteem of
every body, and the consideration which his rank
ought to have given him: that so strange a way
of life, as well as the opinion that was prevalent
that he would never have children by his wife,
though she was as young as himself, induced the
Spaniards to foment the divisions that existed
in this Court, in order to profit by them, and to
try and obtain possession of Casale and of all
the Montferrat; that the said Giuliani had heard
me say, that I was well-informed that the Empress
Eleanor had already declared her pretensions
to put herself in possession of that part of<a class="page" name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a>
the territories of Mantua; that the king of Spain
supported strongly those of a Spanish nobleman,
who, in virtue of his marriage with the niece of
the Duke of Guastalla, by whom he has children,
maintains that he is the sole heir of that duke,
to the prejudice of the Duke of Mantua, who has
married his daughter, and who is besides his
nearest relation; that, on the other hand, the
absolute control over all the territories of this
prince, and all the revenues, were in the hands
of his mother and of the monk Bulgarini; that,
of all those who serve him as ministers, some are
gained by the Spaniards, others by the Empress
Eleanor, and the rest by the Duke of Guastalla;
that his mother has also a part of them on her
side, but that these are the smallest number, and
in short, that it is a sort of miracle that he has
not been already deprived of his territories, but
that he runs the risk of it every day, and that
the misfortune may happen to him when he is
the least prepared for it; that he has no choice
of the means to be made use of to guarantee
himself against it, but that it is the protection of
your Majesty which is alone able to give him
complete security. Matthioli replied to him, that<a class="page" name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a>
all he had been saying to him was quite true,
and that he had long, with grief, seen the truth
of it; but that there was still a remedy for so
great an evil; that he was sufficiently acquainted
with the Duke of Mantua to know that he had
more talent and ambition than he was thought
to have; that, if I approved of it, he would discover
his real sentiments, and that he would
charge himself with whatever negociation I wished.
That, meanwhile, he would go to&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="footnote-anchor">159</a>,
in order to be nearer to Mantua, where he could
not go without making himself suspected by the
different parties who governed there, and that
there he would wait till I made known to him
my intentions. Some days afterwards, he sent
me word that he had found means to have a secret
interview with the Duke of Mantua; and that
he wished me, in order that we might act in concert,
to send him Giuliani, whom I have always
made use of in the different journeys that were
to be made, because his employment of sending
the news through the different parts of Italy, gave
him occasion to go from one town to another, and<a class="page" name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a>
prevented any suspicion of him, as there would
have infallibly been, if I had sent any one of my
household. I despatched him, therefore, with a
new instruction, and not only had he an audience
of the Duke of Mantua, to whom he spoke as I
had desired him, but this prince even approved
very much of the proposition that was made him,
to deliver him from the continual inquietudes
caused him by the Spaniards, and that, for this
purpose, Casale should be put into your Majesty&#8217;s
hands, with the understanding that I should try
to obtain from you in his favour all that he could
reasonably ask for. Finally, he declared that his
resolution was taken upon this subject, but, that
things might be better adjusted, he wished to
communicate it to two of his counsellors, in whom
he had the most confidence, and that he gave the
selection of them to Matthioli, in order that he
might be quite secure of them. Matthioli named
the Marquis Cavriani and Joseph Varano, in
whom he has confidence. Meanwhile the Duke
of Mantua sent Giuliani to me, to acquaint me
with what had passed, and recommended him
to return as soon as possible, in order to receive
the draft of the plan, which would then be pre<a class="page" name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a>pared&mdash;and
to convey it to me. I was much
pleased, Sire, to see the affair in so good a train.
I sent Giuliani back quickly, and ordered him to
tell the Duke of Mantua that I entreated him to
allow me to have a conference with him; that
your Majesty had not as yet any knowledge of
the proposed treaty, because I could not venture
to go so far as that, without being certain first
that he would not disavow me in what I should
have the honour of writing to your Majesty, and
also that he would have sufficient power to execute
what had been arranged.</p>

<p>Giuliani returned here yesterday, bringing me
as favourable answers as I could possibly desire.
He told me that the two counsellors of the Duke
of Mantua had, with every sort of precaution,
commenced their negociation with Matthioli; that
they had approved of the resolution of their master,
and that they had put down in the schedule,
with which they had charged him, and which I
join to this letter, what the Duke requests your
Majesty to grant to him; that afterwards the
Duke of Mantua called him to him; that he ordered
him to beg me to assure your Majesty of
his respect and of his attachment to your inter<a class="page" name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a>ests,
and to acquaint me that he had entirely put
himself into the hands of the Count Matthioli; that
he would soon go to Venice, where we might see
one another conveniently and without being observed,
on account of the Carnival, during which,
all the world, even the Doge, and the oldest senators,
go about in mask; that he wished me not to
lose any time in acquainting your Majesty with
this affair, because he feared some surprise from
the Spaniards; but that if I wished him to keep
his word with me, I must not, on any account,
communicate the project to the Cardinal d&#8217;Estrées,
because there was so strong a report in Italy, that
he had your Majesty&#8217;s orders to negociate with
the Princes there, of which the Spaniards had so
great a jealousy, that, upon the least suspicion
they should have of him (the Duke,) they would
ruin him before he could receive assistance from
your Majesty, who would, at the same time, lose
all hope of getting possession of Casale; that he
would take measures to tranquillize them, and to
prevent their having any suspicions of his conduct;
and that if the Cardinal d&#8217;Estrées made him any
propositions, he would only receive them in full
council, and give general answers, which would<a class="page" name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a>
not render him suspected by any body. I thus
find myself precluded from the confidence which
I intended to make of this business to the Cardinal
d&#8217;Estrées, who I believe will soon be here, and
am obliged to keep the secret scrupulously, till I
have received the orders of your Majesty. The
Duke of Mantua also offers to raise a regiment,
provided it be at your Majesty&#8217;s expense, and he
represents, that by recruiting at Mantua and Casale
he shall do much injury to the Spaniards, who
are raising troops there daily; that Joseph Varano,
who is one of the two before-mentioned counsellors,
promises to get a good many soldiers from
the Ferrarese, where he possesses interest, being
Lord of Camerigo. He also implores your Majesty
to make an effort to send a sufficiently strong
army into Italy, to be able to undertake something
considerable; and he assures me, that, in
this case, he will not content himself with having
delivered Casale into the hands of your Majesty,
but will obtain for your Majesty other great advantages,
through the means of his intimate connexions
with the other states of Italy; that the
Duchy of Milan was never so feeble, nor so devoid
of all means of defence, as at present; but<a class="page" name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a>
that, in order to obtain more particular intelligence
upon this head, he has given orders to Matthioli
to go to Milan, to observe every thing there
with attention, and especially to discover the intention
of the Genoese, with regard to the report which
has now been for some time afloat in Italy, that
your Majesty intends sending an army there next
Spring, at the latest. As some accident might
happen to the packets, I have not ventured to
put into mine the letter that the Count Matthioli,
who has certainly served your Majesty well upon
this occasion, does himself the honour to write to
you, but have had it turned into cypher, as well
as the memoir of the demands of the Duke of
Mantua; and I keep the originals, together with
the plan of Casale, which I do not send to your
Majesty for the same reason. I can assure your
Majesty, that I have never told either Giuliani
or Matthioli that you intend to march troops towards
the Milanese; but the latter speaks of it in
his letter, because he has taken for granted the report
which was purposely spread abroad in order
to lead the Duke of Mantua to the determination
I wished him to take; knowing that he desired to
be generalissimo above all things, or rather that<a class="page" name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a>
it was the only thing he was very anxious for, in
order to be considered in Italy like the late Duke
of Modena, and like the late Duke of Mantua,
who at his age commanded in chief the Emperor&#8217;s
army, with the title of Vicar-general of the Empire.
When this Prince is here, there will only
be at the conference we are to hold together,
himself, Matthioli, (whom he has promised to re-establish
in his post of Secretary of State, and to
appoint his first minister, as soon as he shall see
himself restored to his authority, and that the
treaty he intends making with your Majesty shall
have been executed,) the Sieur Giuliani, the Sieur
de Pinchesne, (who is secretary of the embassy,
and of whom M. de Pomponne, who placed him
with me, can answer to your Majesty for the fidelity
and secrecy,) and myself. So the secrecy, so
necessary in this affair, will certainly remain impenetrable.</p>

MATTHIOLI TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Protestations of devotion to Lewis.&mdash;Belief in the good
intentions of the Duke of Mantua.</p>

<p class="date">
December 14th, 1677.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>I take the liberty of bearing testimony to your
Majesty, that among the great Ministers, whom, in
your supreme wisdom, you have sent at different
times into Italy, your ambassador at Venice, the
Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, ought to be distinguished for
his skill and his zeal to seize every occasion, which
may seem to offer him the improvement or the
aggrandizement of your territories.</p>

<p>This Ambassador having confided to me, that,
in order to succeed in the enterprize that you meditate
against the territories of Milan, it would
be necessary to detach the Duke of Mantua from
the Austrian party, and to draw him into that of
your Majesty, I am anxious to contribute every
thing in my feeble power for the success of this
object. Your Majesty will be made acquainted
with all that has passed by the despatches of
the Ambassador. For myself, I bless the destiny,<a class="page" name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a>
which procures me the honour of serving so great
a monarch, whom I regard and revere as a demi-god.</p>

<p>I will transmit to your Majesty all that I shall
learn respecting Casale, which has been fortified
by one of the most skilful engineers of the Milanese.
This engineer has promised us a plan of all
the fortresses of that State, and even, if your Majesty
commands him, he will separate himself from
the service of Spain, who does not know how to
recompense properly the services and the talents
of those who serve her with fidelity. I am convinced
it would be useless in me to enlarge upon the
importance of the fortress of Casale. Your Majesty
must remember, that at different times it has
arrested the progress of many armies, and that it
is the only bulwark, upon which depends the loss
or the preservation to the Spaniards of the territories
of Milan; territories, which for more reasons
than one, ought to belong to your Majesty&#8217;s
crown.</p>

<p>It is known that the Austrians are at this moment
arming, in order to obtain possession by surprize
of Casale, to the prejudice of the Duke Ferdinand,
my master, the lawful possessor of it.</p>

<p><a class="page" name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></p>

<p>This Prince, nephew of Charles<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="footnote-anchor">161</a> the first,
(which latter Prince was rather French than Italian,
and by whose intervention the fortress of
Pignerol has remained in the possession of your
royal house); this Prince, I say, Ferdinand, will
make known, in fit time and place, that he has not
degenerated from his ancestors; he has promised
to serve you with the greatest fidelity, and to
fight for you in a manner worthy of his birth;
and as he is extremely anxious to acquire glory,
I trust your Majesty will have reason to applaud
his conduct in your armies. By the confession of
even the most skilful political observers, he is free
from the suspicions, which may fall upon the
other Italian Sovereigns. The Abbé d&#8217;Estrades
knows that his Highness has communications with
other great personages, who complain with reason
of the insupportable yoke of the Spaniards, and
who will take arms with him to combat, and to<a class="page" name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a>
drive as quickly as possible from Italy, a power
which is only established there to oppress it. If
destiny willed it so, I have no doubt that the other
Princes of this country would be happy to enjoy
a stable peace under the auspices of your Majesty.
I offer up vows for the progress of your victorious
arms, and I pray God to prolong your days for
the consolation of the world, &amp;c.</p>

ESTRADES TO POMPONNE.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Continuation of the negociation.&mdash;Intrigues of the
Austrian Party.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, Dec. 24, 1677.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have only some few particulars to add to the
letter, which I did myself the honour to write to<a class="page" name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a>
the King last week; but as the Duke of Mantua
has made known to me, that they may serve to
make you still more aware how important it is
to that Prince to take his measures secretly, and
to use all possible diligence for the conclusion
of the affair, which I have given an account of
to his Majesty, I have thought it necessary, Sir,
that you should be informed of them. Three
days ago, the Duke of Mantua informed me that
he had found means to procure a copy of the
written orders that the Empress Eleanor and the
Emperor, conjointly with the Spaniards, had given
to the Count Viltaliano Borromei, a Milanese,
and the Imperial Commissary. They are to this
effect, that if the French should come into Italy,
and that it should appear to him that the Duke of
Mantua had any intention to be on their side, he
should make use of this pretext to render himself
master of Casale without delay, by means of their
partizans, who are there in considerable numbers,
and among others, the Governor of the town, and
the Governor of the citadel; in order to preserve
this fortress and all the Montferrat for the Empress
Eleanor. The Marquis Carrossa has received
a similar order with regard to Mantua.<a class="page" name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a>
He is also an Imperial Commissary, and it will be
easy for him to execute what is ordered him, because
the Governor of the citadel is his brother-in-law,
and the Major of the town his intimate
friend. On these accounts, the Duke of Mantua
has sent me word that in his present situation,
in which he is besides watched by his mother,
by the Monk Bulgarini, who governs her, and by
the greater part of his Ministers, who are devoted
to the House of Austria, he is obliged to show no
ambition, to appear to have no knowledge of his
own affairs, and to excite no suspicions by his
conduct; and also that he cannot declare himself
openly in favour of the King&#8217;s interests, as he
would wish to do, nor deliver up Casale to his
Majesty, unless he will send a sufficient army into
Italy to secure that fortress, and to defend him
(the Duke) from the evils that menace him, and
from the designs which the House of Austria has
against him; and that this obliges him to supplicate
and exhort his Majesty to make an effort to
that effect, even if he has not actually resolved
to carry the war into the Milanese, since Casale
is an acquisition sufficiently important to determine
him to it. But Matthioli, to whom the<a class="page" name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a>
Duke of Mantua has given up the entire conduct
of this affair, goes still farther, and is confident,
that even in this case means could be easily found
to place a Governor in the citadel of Mantua, and
a Major in the town, who should be as much
attached to the service of the King, as those who
at present occupy these two posts are to the
House of Austria.</p>

<p>We must, besides, Sir, consider that the Duke
of Guastalla, being the nearest relation of the Duke
of Mantua, as well as his heir, there would be
danger that, if the Duchess his daughter, who is
very ill, and has no children, should die, some
misfortune might happen to the Duke of Mantua,
which would assure his territories to the Spanish
nobleman, who has married the second daughter
of the Duke of Guastalla, and whose marriage
the Spaniards, doubtless with this view, made
up at Vienna, by means of Don Vincent, who returned
from thence some time back. You know
much better than I do, Sir, of what consequence
it would be to the king, not only to take away the
Mantuan and the Montferrat from the House of
Austria, who will never lose an opportunity of
making use of them when they have once ob<a class="page" name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a>tained
them, but besides to have in his own hands
these two states, by means of which his Majesty
can easily bridle the Princes of Italy. Therefore,
I do not take the liberty of entering farther upon
this matter, or of mingling my reflections with those
you may choose to make upon it.</p>

do them this pleasure; and, Sir, I could almost

<p>You will see by the letter of the King which
goes herewith, how much his Majesty approves of<a class="page" name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a>
the negociation, which you have entered into with
the Duke of Mantua, for an affair undoubtedly
very important at all times, but especially so at
this conjuncture: you could not also have conducted
yourself in it with greater prudence, or
greater secrecy than you have done.</p>

<p>I am very happy to see that you have taken
advantage of this occasion, to testify your zeal for
the service of his Majesty; and I hope that the
success of the affair may assist you in procuring
the sooner from his Majesty, the favour that you
have asked of him.</p>

<p>We have not, at present, any news to send you
from these parts; the King&#8217;s heavy baggage set off
Monday morning, for St. Quentin, as I sent you
word; but his Majesty has not, as yet, made any
preparation to follow it.</p>

LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH TO ESTRADES.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Approval of the negociation.&mdash;Answer to the demands of
the Duke of Mantua.</p>

<p class="date">St. Germain, January 12th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Abbé d&#8217;Estrades</span>,</p>

<p>I have seen with pleasure, by your letter of
the 18th of last month, the pains you have taken,
as well to draw the Duke of Mantua from the
lethargy of debauchery in which he is sunk,
as to excite him to throw off the yoke of the
Archduchess, his mother, and of the Monk
Bulgarini; who, without leaving him any part
in the government of his territories, add every
day to the shackles and the dependance, by means
of which they have subjected him to the House of
Austria. I take so much a greater interest in the
more noble resolutions he seems disposed to take,
on account of his belonging to a family, which
was so long settled in France, and to which the
King, my father, gave such great proofs of his
friendship and protection. I should, therefore,<a class="page" name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a>
wish you to let him know, by the same channels
as those you made use of to commence this negociation,
that I have learned with much satisfaction,
the favourable dispositions he has manifested
for my interests, and for taking himself a
part more worthy of his fame and his birth; that
on these accounts, I receive with pleasure the propositions
he has made you of attaching himself to
me by a union of measures, and by admitting my
troops into Casale, upon the same terms as those
by which they formerly, for so long a time, held
possession of the place. Experience ought to have
taught him, that the authority of his father was
never more firmly established in the Montferrat,
than when that fortress and those territories were
supported by my protection; and the affection for
the French name, which has still remained among
the people, is a sufficient testimony of the advantage
and kindness they received from them.</p>

<p>In rendering an answer to the articles that he
has communicated to you, I shall commence by
replying to the first; that, with regard to the offer
of delivering up to me the citadel and fortress of
Casale, I shall willingly content myself with holding
them in the same manner in which I held them<a class="page" name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a>
formerly; that is to say, under the condition of
preserving them for the Duke of Mantua, and of
paying the garrisons I shall keep there. I would
also, in order to favour the warlike inclinations of
this Prince, take measures with him respecting the
command of the armies I shall send across the
Alps. But he must be aware, that I cannot at all
enter into any consideration of the article, in
which he demands, that I should get restored to
him the parts of the Montferrat, which have
been ceded to the Duke of Savoy. These cessions
have been recognized by so many treaties, in which
I have been a principal party, that I cannot do
any thing that would invalidate them; all that
I could possibly do, would be to employ myself,
as I have several times done, to accommodate the
differences which still exist between them, with
regard to the valuation of those same portions of
territory, and the sums that ought to be paid for
them by the Duke of Savoy.</p>

<p>It is a different case with regard to the losses
which the Duke of Mantua might sustain in the
war he may possibly be engaged in together with
me. I would willingly bind myself not to make
peace, unless compensation was made to him; and<a class="page" name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a>
I would equally enter, with pleasure, into an agreement
to share with him any conquests my arms
might make in the Milanese.</p>

<p>As for his demand, that I should now make
him a present of a hundred thousand Pistoles,
simply as a gift, you must make him understand
that this sum is too large, but that I should be
ready to agree to a more moderate one, according
to the engagements he is willing to enter into with
me; and without explaining yourself as to what
the sum should be, you will make him first state
what he expects, and oblige him to keep within
reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>You will still continue to entertain the opinion
that I intend sending a considerable army this
year into Italy, and you will keep principally in
view in your negociation, the having it in such
a state as to be able to prolong it without the
danger of being obliged to break it off; since
it is for the good of my service to continue it
always in such a manner, that I may be the master
to conduct it as I please, either by enlarging
or narrowing the conditions. It is on this account,
that as the Count Matthioli has thus far
been the principal confidant of this affair, and that<a class="page" name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a>
he must be the most powerful instrument of it,
it is necessary that you should keep him always
in good humour, by the assurance of the especial
good-will I bear him for his conduct, and by the
hope of the marks of it I shall be inclined to give
him. This is what I wish you to say in addition
to the letter which I send you for him, in answer
to the one he wrote to me.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, January 29th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have nothing to add to what I did myself the
honour to write to the King, upon the present
state of the affair, which I am treating of with the
Duke of Mantua. It goes on so rapidly, that
I am reduced to be sorry that I cannot find any
difficulties, which, without rendering the eventual
success of it doubtful, might prolong the negocia<a class="page" name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a>tions
as long as the King seems to wish; but I
have the greatest difficulty to encourage the Duke
of Mantua, under the fear he is in of the Spaniards,
which, to say the truth, is pretty well
founded; nor can he think himself in security,
unless he sees himself supported by all the protection
the King can give. Nevertheless, I will
take care that this Prince does not escape us, even
if the affair should not be as quickly concluded
as he desires. I return you a thousand most humble
thanks, Sir, for all the kindness you show me
on this occasion; and I can assure you, that I shall
be much more anxious for the success of this affair,
from my pleasure at having made known to the
King by it the zeal I have for his service, and
having rendered myself worthy of the favour you
have done me, in procuring for me the situation I
at present hold, than from any hope of thereby
bettering my fortune.</p>

ESTRADES TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Conference with Matthioli.&mdash;Discussion of the demands of
the Duke of Mantua.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, January 29th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>At the time that I received the letter which
your Majesty did me the honour to write to me
on the 12th of this month, having learned that the
Count Matthioli was arrived at Venice, I sent to
him to say that I desired to have a conference with
him, in consequence of which he came to my
house with the usual precautions. I first delivered
into his hands the letter with which your Majesty
had charged me for him, which he received
with all possible marks of respect and gratitude;
and I told him, as your Majesty had commanded
me, that you would not content yourself with testifying
with your own hand the satisfaction you
feel at the zeal he has shown for your interests,
but that you also ordered me expressly to assure
him, that you were anxious to give him other<a class="page" name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a>
marks of it. I added to this, that he ought to
think himself happy to have found an occasion of
meriting the kindness and favours of your Majesty,
which he could easily do through the means
of the implicit confidence placed in him by the
Duke of Mantua, to whom he would also have the
satisfaction, at the same time, of rendering the
greatest service in his power. He answered me in
a manner that does not permit me to doubt his
being as grateful as it is possible to be for your
Majesty&#8217;s goodness, and his having a very strong
wish to serve you. Afterwards I read to him the
obliging expressions your Majesty makes use of
to mark your affection for the Duke of Mantua,
and those other parts of your Majesty&#8217;s despatch,
which I thought myself authorized to communicate,
that he might know that you had learned
with pleasure the proposals of that Prince, and
that he might be aware of the considerable advantages,
which would be derived from the strict alliance
he (the Duke) would enter into with your
Majesty by means of Casale, which you were willing
to hold possession of on the same terms as
formerly; that is to say, paying the garrison you
should keep up in the place, and preserving it for<a class="page" name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a>
the Duke of Mantua. We afterwards came to
talk upon his differences with the Duke of Savoy,
for the restitution claimed by him of the
parts of the Montferrat, which have been ceded to
the latter; and it was not till after some slight disputing,
that I made the Count Matthioli agree,
by means of the same reasons you did me the honour
to detail to me, that <i>you</i> could not enter into
this affair in any other way, than by employing
yourself to accommodate it; but that the intercession
of your Majesty was sufficiently powerful
to obtain a satisfactory result for the Duke of
Mantua.</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli at length contented himself
upon this point, but he had more difficulty
to give way upon the demand of the present of one
hundred thousand pistoles. He was the more obstinate
in not taking off any thing from this sum,
because he said that it was to be made use of for
the interests of your Majesty; and that the Duke
of Mantua having taken possession of Guastalla,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="footnote-anchor">171</a>
without giving notice to the Spaniards, he had<a class="page" name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a>
judged it necessary to be upon his guard against
the umbrage they might take at this measure;
that for this purpose he had placed in Guastalla
and in Casale the troops he had raised, and
whom he was obliged to pay; that he had sent
into the latter town great stores of corn and forage,
and that he could not support this expense
in the state to which he was reduced by his mother,
who disposed entirely of his revenues. I answered
him, that the sum of money, which the
Duke of Mantua requested your Majesty to give
him at present, was not necessary to him for the
expenses which he alleged; that the augmentation
of the garrison of Casale, and the provisions
sent into it, were regarded by the Spaniards themselves
as precautions that he wisely took against
the enterprises of France, at a time when it was
no longer doubted that the latter power intended
to carry the war into Italy; and that therefore
neither the partizans of the Spanish faction who
are about him, nor his mother, could refuse him the
money he wanted for that purpose; that I knew
that his subjects would contribute with pleasure,
and that they had shown the greatest joy at their
Sovereign&#8217;s applying himself to his own affairs;<a class="page" name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a>
that till the conclusion of the treaty, which was to
unite him so firmly with your Majesty, he would
have no occasion for any new expenses, and that
he would then receive all the assistance and succour
which he could expect from your Majesty;
that your Majesty, by engaging yourself to pay
and keep up the garrisons in Casale, ceded to the
Duke the entire enjoyment of the property and
revenues without any deduction, and that your
Majesty would have no farther advantage in this
affair, than that of delivering him from the yoke
which the House of Austria had imposed upon him;
and of facilitating the conquests in the Milanese, of
which you were to give him a share; so that the
present which he asked for, being to be considered
purely in the light of a gratification, a hundred
thousand pistoles was a demand so excessive, that
your Majesty had not judged it right to make any
offer in consequence, and that you had only ordered
me to tell him, that you would have no objection
to make a present to the Duke of a more
moderate sum; that therefore it was necessary for
him to explain himself clearly upon the subject.</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli for some time refused to
say any thing, taking a line which was in appear<a class="page" name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a>ance
very civil, which was, that he threw himself
upon the generosity of your Majesty. But seeing
that I continued to desire him to speak, he reduced
the sum by little and little to five hundred
thousand livres. I told him, that I guessed pretty
well what the Duke of Mantua might hope for
from your Majesty, and that I could not charge
myself to lay <i>this proposal</i> before you, and that I
also could not help telling him, that for a man who
professed to be so well-intentioned, he appeared to
me very unyielding upon a point of small moment,
in a negociation from which he would allow, without
doubt, that the Duke of Mantua would derive
great and solid advantages. Finally, Sire, I
brought him to content himself with one hundred
thousand crowns, and that on condition that your
Majesty was not to pay them till after the signature
of the treaty, and the exchange of the ratifications;
and then, if you chose not to give the
whole sum at once, that the Duke of Mantua
should receive fifty thousand crowns first, and
then the other fifty thousand three months afterwards.
Besides this, I declared to the Count
Matthioli that I could not answer for your Majesty&#8217;s
approving of my having fixed upon so large a<a class="page" name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a>
sum, but that I promised him to do all that depended
on me, to prevent my being disavowed.</p>

<p>Not only have the other articles of your Majesty&#8217;s
despatch been agreed to without difficulty,
but they have even served powerfully to confirm
the Count Matthioli in his opinion, that the Duke
of Mantua cannot take a better course than that
of abandoning himself entirely to the protection
of your Majesty. He has so firm a belief in the
resolution he is convinced you have taken of
sending a considerable army this year into Italy,
that I should have no difficulty in persuading him
still more strongly of it; but I am a little embarrassed
with the anxiety of the Duke of Mantua to
conclude this affair, which is caused to him by his
continual terror of the design, which he understands
the Spaniards continue to have, of seizing
upon his fortresses on the least pretext, and on the
first favourable occasion. Nevertheless, I will endeavour
to lengthen the negociation as much as your
Majesty shall find useful to your interests, as you
have commanded me, and at the same time I will
take care not to put it in any danger of being broken
off. I implore your Majesty to be persuaded that
I shall never be forgetful of any thing which may<a class="page" name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a>
be for the good of your service, or which may
testify the zeal and the profound respect, with
which I am, Sire,</p>

<p class="abstract">The Duke of Mantua watched by the Spaniards.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, February 12th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Though the Duke of Mantua has been for the
last fortnight at Venice, I have not yet been able
to see him; but he has sent me word several
times, by the Count Matthioli, that he had still
more impatience than even I have, that we should<a class="page" name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a>
confer together; that he only deferred giving
himself that satisfaction, in order that he might
first get rid of those of his people whom he has
the least confidence in, and particularly four men,
whom his mother has sent with him here to observe
all his actions, which they do with the
greatest care; and that two days before he sets off
to return to his own territories (where he is not
afraid of any surprise, when he shall be once there
himself), he will acquaint me with the time and
place at which we may see one another. It is
true, that the step he has taken, of at once seizing
upon the territories of the late Duke of Guastalla,
has very much disquieted the Spaniards; and one
sees that they are endeavouring, by all sorts of
means, to ascertain whether the Duke of Mantua
has taken any measures to gain the support of the
King. His resident at Venice, who is devoted to the
Duchess his mother, came two days ago to the
Sieur de Pinchesne to ask, on the part of his master,
whether I was about to despatch an extraordinary
courier to Paris, because his highness
would be glad to make use of him to convey there
a packet of consequence: he answered him, that
affairs were so little of a pressing nature here, that<a class="page" name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a>
I always wrote by the usual conveyance, and that
I had not at present any reason for sending a
courier; but that, if the Duke of Mantua wished
it, I would send one on his account. I made this
known to the Prince himself, who was surprized
that his resident, in his name, and without his
order, should have made a request of that nature;
and as he was of opinion, as well as myself, that
the intention of his resident was by this means to
discover whether a packet, which, it was said, the
Duke of Mantua had received from the Grand
Duchess,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="footnote-anchor">173</a> was of importance, he agreed to the
expedient which I proposed to him, of sending
publicly to make him the same offers as those
which had been made to his resident, in order
that he might be able to express before his ministers
his disapprobation of their entering,
without his knowledge, into communications with
the French ambassador, being aware of the mea<a class="page" name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a>sures
which it was necessary for him to keep. He
charged Matthioli to tell me that he had had a
letter from the Grand Duchess, to which he had
sent an answer, for the purpose of begging her to
support his claims to the King; having heard that
the Duke of Modena<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="footnote-anchor">174</a> had complained to his Majesty
of his having taken possession of the succession
of the Duke of Guastalla, to which the Duke of
Modena had pretensions. The Sieur de Pinchesne
went to him from me, and the thing was executed
as it had been previously determined upon; but
his adventure, as well as many other things which
the Duke of Mantua discovers daily, convince
him that the Spaniards are suspicious of him, on
which account he is so uneasy, that he is more
than ever anxious for your Majesty to secure him
quickly against their enterprises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will have seen by the last letters I did
myself the honour to write to you, that I take care
to keep up the negociation I have entered into

that I shall apply myself, as you command me
in your last letter of the 2d of this month, to
gain time, and to confirm the Duke of Mantua in
the resolution he has taken of abandoning himself
to the King&#8217;s protection. He is as thoroughly
persuaded as one could wish, that he cannot
take a better course, although the Spaniards have
lately been making him large offers of money and
of employment, in order to oblige him to declare<a class="page" name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a>
himself openly in their favour, and to allow of the
introduction of a garrison of Germans into Casale;
but as he is always apprehensive, lest his want of
affection for the House of Austria should be
discovered, he can never think himself in security
till he shall be supported by a treaty; and it is this
which gives him so much impatience to conclude
the one he intends making with the King.</p>

ESTRADES TO POMPONNE.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Plans of the Spaniards.&mdash;Dispositions of the Venetian Government.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, February 26th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> not had the honour of receiving any
letters from you this week. Indeed, I expected<a class="page" name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a>
that the hurry of the King&#8217;s departure would prevent
your writing. I have learned from good
authority, that the government here have received
intelligence, that the Spaniards have renewed their
proposals to form a league of the Princes of
Italy against France, and that it was at Rome that
they concerted the means to succeed in it: this is,
without doubt, what has given occasion to the report
which has been current for some days, that
the Cardinal Porto Carrero<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="footnote-anchor">177</a>, in his way to Spain,
where he is going to take possession of the Archbishopric
of Toledo, is to visit the different Courts
of Italy, to try to engage them in the party
which they call <i>the common cause</i>. It is said, that
the Grand Duke<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="footnote-anchor">178</a> has already made known his<a class="page" name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a>
opinion, that if they intend to unite, it ought to
be for the maintenance of their liberty, and that
they ought not to engage themselves in an extensive
war, or to assist in enabling one of the two belligerent
powers to oppress them eventually with
greater ease. This intelligence has obliged me to
give all my attention to penetrate the sentiments of
the Venetian government upon this subject; and I
have been informed, upon good authority, that
thus far the determination is to deliver themselves
from the importunities of the Spaniards, if they
should be too pressing, by a similar reply to that
which is said to have been given at Florence; but
it now appears to me, that the fear and jealousy of
the power of the King, which existed here formerly,
is very much reviving, and they are becoming
apprehensive that the designs of his Majesty
are not confined to the preservation of the
conquests he has already made, nor even to those
he may make in Flanders. The senate is confirmed
in this opinion, by the letters of M. Contarini,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="footnote-anchor">179</a><a class="page" name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a>
who sends them word that they must not look for
peace, because the King is against it. This way
of talking persuades me, that M. Contarini is
either ill-intentioned or ignorant&mdash;and his intelligence
is very capable of augmenting the disquietudes
of the senate. I have shewn, as well as
I was able, to those I have spoken to upon the
subject, that it is impossible to act with more sincerity
in favour of peace, or to facilitate more
the means of procuring it, than his Majesty has
done. There is, however, no probability that, in
the present state of the affairs of the Republic of
Venice, and under the perpetual fear she is in of
the Grand Vizier,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="footnote-anchor">180</a> she will dare to declare herself
in favour of the enemies of the King; but, Sir, I<a class="page" name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a>
can assure you, from the knowledge I have upon
the subject, that at the present time, we must only
reckon upon the weakness of the Venetians, and
upon the poverty of their finances, and not upon
their good intentions towards us. If I might be
permitted to give my opinion upon the present conjuncture,
I should say that there is not a more ready,
or more certain way of ruining all the measures of
the Spaniards in Italy, and of terminating in the
King&#8217;s favour the irresolutions of the Senate, than
by binding the Duke of Mantua by the treaty
which he is willing to make with his Majesty: not
only is he always in the same resolution of concluding
this affair, on account of the Emperor&#8217;s having
sent word to him that he does not wish to deprive
him of the succession of the Duke<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="footnote-anchor">181</a> his father-in-law,
but that he only desires him to withdraw the
garrison he has placed in Guastalla: but besides,
because his Imperial Majesty presses him to execute
a treaty made by the late Duke, his father;
which was an engagement that he should never
have any but a German garrison in Casale. The
Duke of Mantua shows me the greatest confidence,<a class="page" name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a>
sends me word, by the Count Matthioli, what is
deliberating on the state of affairs, in order to
know my opinions before he decides any thing.
You may be sure, Sir, that I omit nothing on my
part to encourage his good dispositions, and to keep
the negociation always in that state, that the King
may be the complete master of it. The Duke of
Mantua requested me, ten days ago, to come and
see him ride at the academy. I went accordingly,
and found that he was really very firm on horseback,
though he has not a graceful seat, on account
of his leg having been formerly broke, and that it
is the custom here to wear the stirrups very short.
As he piques himself upon being a good horseman,
he was much pleased at my praises, which were repeated
to him by the Count Matthioli; and at my
promising to repeat them in the first letter I should
have occasion to write to you.</p>

<p>Two of the most considerable gentlemen of this
republic, whose names are, Cornaro the elder,
called &#8220;of the great House,&#8221; and a Foscarini,
are already intriguing to succeed M. Contarini, in
the embassy to France, although the choice cannot
be made till the month of September; upon<a class="page" name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a>
whichever of the two it shall fall, he will fill the
situation worthily, above all in the article of expense,
as they are both very rich and very generous.</p>

<p>Although I took the liberty, Sir, to request, in
my last letter, your protection with M. Colbert,<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="footnote-anchor">182</a> for
the payment of my appointment, and, above all, for
the payment of those of the first six months of the
year 1676, for which I have long had the orders, I
have not yet been able to obtain them. I am, however,
forced by my pressing necessities to renew my
request, and to supplicate you most humbly to
procure me this favour from M. Colbert. I trust,
Sir, you will be kind enough to afford me this
mark of your affection, which is the greatest I can
possibly receive, in the embarrassment in which I<a class="page" name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a>
at present find myself; and that you will be always
persuaded that I am, with profound respect, and
unalterable attachment,</p>

POMPONNE TO ESTRADES.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Recommendations of Delay in the Negociation.</p>

<p class="date">Cambray, March 1st, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have rendered an account to the King, during
his journey, of your despatches of the 29th of January
and 5th of February. I shall not now
have time enough to send you a long answer to
them. I shall therefore only tell you, that his
Majesty saw in them the continuation of the negociation
which you have entered into with the
Count Matthioli; that you had been discussing<a class="page" name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a>
the points which he proposed to you, and those
which his Majesty wishes neither to grant nor to
refuse; that you had even descended to the detail
of the sum which had been demanded, and
that you had reduced it to one hundred thousand
crowns. On these subjects I have to inform you,
Sir, that his Majesty approves entirely of your
continuing a negociation, which may eventually
be of very considerable importance; but for this
it is necessary that the opportunities should be
favourable, and the more so, as the basis of whatever
treaty is concluded, must necessarily be the
King&#8217;s sending a powerful army across the Alps.
You, I am sure, are sufficiently aware, that thus
far events do not seem to favour such a project;
it is, however, always advisable to continue to encourage
the belief of it, and this is what his Majesty
thinks it will be best for you to do; but he
does not see the necessity for your entering into
any engagement upon a point, which must fail of
success, and which would render useless any expense
his Majesty may go to. Therefore, Sir,
your best course to pursue is, to cultivate always
the good intentions of the Count Matthioli, and
through him those of his master; not to put an<a class="page" name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a>
end to the hope they have to see the arms of
France in Italy; but to defer the answer they expect
from you, partly upon the ground of the
journey and the campaign in which his Majesty
is at present engaged, which prevents his writing
to you, and partly upon other reasons; but still
to keep the negociation, as much as you are able,
in such a state as his Majesty may be able to
take advantage of, according to the conjuncture of
<span class="nowrap">affairs.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p class="date">Venice, March 12, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The hurry which I know always prevails on
a march, left me but little hope of hearing from<a class="page" name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a>
you till you arrived at Metz, and I am therefore
the more obliged to you for your kindness, in
writing to me on the 15th of last month from
Vitry.</p>

<p>I have nothing certain to send you to-day;
but next week I shall have the honour of sending
to the King an account of the conference, which
I am decidedly to have to-morrow evening with
the Duke of Mantua. All the measures are taken
for this purpose; and that Prince has sent me
word that he will explain to me the reasons which
oblige him to send the Count Matthioli, without
delay, to your Majesty; he will not, however, set
off for ten or twelve days, and I explained to him
that it was necessary first that I should be made
acquainted with the subject of his mission. I
thought it necessary to obtain a knowledge of it,
in order that his Majesty may be fully informed
before the Count Matthioli waits upon him. I can
only assure you at present, that things could not be
better disposed for the formation of a powerful
league in Italy, to drive the Spaniards entirely out
of it, in case the King chooses to turn his arms to
this side. This is what you shall be informed of
more in detail, and more particularly, in my next<a class="page" name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a>
despatch; because I shall be able to speak to you
upon the subject with certainty, after I have
learned from the Count Matthioli, the success of
a negociation which he has entered into lately
with the Republic, in the name of the Duke of
Mantua, to which I am privy. We agreed that
the pretext he should make use of, was the desire
of that Prince to regulate himself by the counsels
of the Senate, after having communicated to them
his legitimate rights to Guastalla, and the well-grounded
fears he entertains from the sentiments
displayed by the House of Austria towards him
in this affair. M. Matthioli has already had two
conferences with a sage of the <i>terra firma</i>, named
Lando, a deputy of the College, and he is to have
three more with him this week; which will discover
to us the real dispositions of the Senate towards
his Majesty. It is easy to see by the manner
in which this senator has already spoken, that
if a French army was to arrive in Italy, the Republic
would prefer profiting by the misfortunes
and weakness of the House of Austria, by joining
her arms to those of the King, to remaining in a
neutrality, which would appear to her dangerous,
while the army of so powerful a prince was carry<a class="page" name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a>ing
on war at her gates. These political views of
the Venetians justify what I have already had the
honour of remarking to you, that we must expect
nothing from them, except what fear or interest
may oblige them <span class="nowrap">to.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have not had the honour of receiving any
letter from you this week. You will see by the
account I send to the King, what passed at the
conference I had with the Duke of Mantua. I
will only add to it, Sir, that, if his Majesty deems
it to his advantage, that this Prince should be
united with him, according to the conditions which<a class="page" name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a>
have been proposed, it appears to me that it will
be necessary, before the Count Matthioli sets off
for Paris, to put this affair in a situation in which
it is no longer liable to be broken off; because
I have seen the Duke of Mantua so alarmed at
the menaces of the Spaniards, and at the protection
they afford openly to the Count de Prades,<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="footnote-anchor">186</a>
who pretends that the Duchy of Guastalla belongs
to him, that I have been unable to tranquillize
his fears, except by giving him the hope that the
return of the Count Matthioli will deliver him
from all his embarrassments; and if he was to
see him return without bringing the King&#8217;s consent
for the conclusion of the affair, and without
a certain assurance of speedy assistance, I do not
know whether the fear of being stripped of his territories
would not make him change his resolution.<a class="page" name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a>
I have thought, Sir, that I ought to inform you
faithfully of the situation in which I find the
mind of the Duke of Mantua, in order that you
may regulate yourself accordingly.</p>

<p>The Senate has discovered that the Pope<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="footnote-anchor">187</a> has
let drop, of his own accord, the affair of the adjustment
between the Republic and Spain, on the
occasion of what has passed at Trieste, because
His Holiness wishes to be the only Mediator
of the Catholic Princes at the Assembly of Nimeguen,
and that the Ambassador of Venice should
not divide this honour with his <span class="nowrap">Nuncio.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

ESTRADES TO LEWIS THE FOURTEENTH.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Account of his Interview with the Duke of Mantua.&mdash;The
latter insists upon sending Matthioli to Paris.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, March 19th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>A week ago I communicated to M. de Pomponne
that I was to have a conference the next
day with the Duke of Mantua. We met, as had
been concerted, at midnight, in a small open place,
which is at an equal distance from his house and
mine. I was an entire hour with him, and not
only did I tell him all that your Majesty had
desired me to apprize him of, and which he had
already learned from the Count Matthioli, but
besides, I re-assured him, as much as I was able,
upon the subject of the constant, and indeed well-grounded,
alarms he is in with regard to the Spaniards.
I did not explain myself to him with regard
to the present your Majesty intends making
to him in money, as soon as the treaty shall be
concluded; but contented myself with promising<a class="page" name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a>
that he should have reason to be content with
it. He appeared to be much satisfied with our
conversation; and, on my side, I have no less reason
to be so; since he has confirmed to me all that
the Count Matthioli told me from him. I have
given so exact an account of these things to your
Majesty in the letters I have had the honour to
write to yourself and to M. de Pomponne, that it
is useless for me to enlarge more upon this subject.
When we were upon the point of separating, the
Duke of Mantua represented to me the risk he
is in of being overwhelmed by the Spaniards,
whose bad intentions he cannot doubt of, after
their late earnest persuasions to him, to admit
the Germans into Casale, to withdraw his garrison
from Guastalla, and to declare himself openly
and without delay in their favour. He added,
that I must be aware, that under the resolution he
had taken of serving your Majesty, both with his
person and his territories, he would do nothing
prejudicial to your interests; but that, if the Spaniards
did not give him more money than what
they were accustomed to furnish him with, for the
support of the garrison of Casale, as they had
declared to him was their intention, he should not<a class="page" name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a>
be able to support the expense of it himself, or to
preserve that fortress; that the danger was so
pressing, that no time was to be lost in placing
him in a state of safety, and that affairs went on
so slowly by means of despatches, that he found
himself obliged to send the Count Matthioli to
your Majesty, to expose to you the state to which
he finds himself reduced, and to implore you to
deliver him from it as quickly as may be possible.</p>

<p>I have not dared, Sire, to oppose myself to this
journey, because I perceived that the Duke of
Mantua had taken some offence, or at least that
he had some uneasiness at the length of this negociation,
which I have protracted upon different
pretexts as much as I was able, without endangering
it, as your Majesty had ordered me; and because
besides I have thought that you would be
the more assured of the firmness of the Duke of
Mantua, when the Count Matthioli, in whom he
has a blind confidence, and who governs him absolutely,
should be with you. He will make
known to your Majesty, better than can be done
by letters, the facilities you would find in conquering
the Milanese, the intelligences that may
be established there, and the detail of the whole<a class="page" name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a>
negociation he has had with the Republic of
Venice in the name of the Duke of Mantua, who
demanded the advice of the Senate upon the affair
of Guastalla, and its assistance, in case it was attempted
to disturb him by force in the possession
of that Duchy. The Senate has sent word to
Matthioli, by a Sage of <i>terra firma</i>, who was deputed
for this purpose, that the Duke of Mantua
ought to retain possession of Guastalla; that the
Republic would render him all the good offices
she could, and that even if her intercession should
be of no avail, she would still assist him secretly
with advice and money, and not abandon him.
This Senator gave him to understand, that if your
Majesty was to send an army into Italy, and that
the Duke of Mantua should be in your interests,
the Republic would not be disinclined to enter
into the same party; and the Procurator Nani,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="footnote-anchor">189</a><a class="page" name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a>
with whom he has also had two conversations, explained
himself upon this subject still more clearly.</p>

<p>As the Count Matthioli is not to receive his instructions
till the day after to-morrow, he will
not, certainly, set off from hence till towards the
end of the week. I shall have the honour of acquainting
your Majesty with what they contain of
most importance, as well as with the time by
which the Count Matthioli can be with you.</p>

ESTRADES TO POMPONNE.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Reasons for consenting to the mission of Matthioli to Paris.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, March 26th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>My last letters will have shown you that I had
forestalled in some measure, the orders which I
received in the one of the 4th of this month, which
you did me the honour to write me. I had judged
that, in the present conjuncture, it would not be
easy for the King to send a powerful army into
Italy, so speedily as was wished. It appeared to
me, nevertheless, that His Majesty considered the
negociation which I had commenced with the
Duke of Mantua, through the means of the Count
Matthioli, as an affair which might eventually be
of use to him, and which he would wish to be in
a situation to profit by. Therefore, Sir, I have
used all my endeavours to encourage the opinion
already entertained, that the arms of France will
appear in the Milanese, and to confirm the Duke
of Mantua in his good dispositions towards His<a class="page" name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a>
Majesty, and in his suspicions of the Spaniards. I
had even made use of the same reasons, which
you prescribe to me to urge in your letter, to moderate
his impatience to conclude the treaty, which
he is desirous of making with the King. Before
His Majesty left St. Germain, I represented to the
Count Matthioli that the negociations with England
occupied him too much, to permit him, in
such very critical times, to apply himself as much
as was necessary to a new enterprize of the importance
of the one that was meditated in Italy;
and since that, I have alleged to him the difficulty
of getting answers during the hurry of the
journey, and the occupations of the campaign,
which oblige the King to go frequently from one
place to another. I have added, that I was by
no means surprized at this, and that, in preceding
years, I had rarely received any letters from you
at those times. He has contented himself, thus
far, with the excuses I have given him; but the
Duke of Mantua is so violently alarmed at the
peril in which he believes himself to be, and at
the length of the negociation, that he has absolutely
determined upon sending the Count Matthioli
to the King&mdash;and I have not dared to oppose<a class="page" name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a>
myself to this, from the fear of giving him suspicions,
or of disgusting him with the negociation
altogether. It is true, Sir, that after having well
considered the manner in which this journey could
be accomplished, I have thought that it would
turn out to be the most easy and the most infallible
method to confirm still more the dispositions of
the Duke of Mantua, and to prolong this affair
as long as the King shall judge for the good of
his service. I have for this purpose persuaded
the Count Matthioli that it was important he
should not go immediately to his Majesty, but that
he should first pay a visit to some of the towns in
Italy, under the pretext of his master&#8217;s interests,
and his disputes with the Duke of Modena respecting
the Duchy of Guastalla, in order that there
may be no suspicion of his going into France.
He is agreed upon this point with me; and by the
reckoning we have made together of his course,
and the halts he will make, I can assure you, Sir,
that you will not see him for these two months. It
will be still easier for you, when he does arrive, to
detain him at least as long; and thus the campaign
will be nearly finished without the Duke of Mantua&#8217;s
being able to complain of the delay, or to<a class="page" name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a>
take measures contrary to the King&#8217;s intentions.
Since this Prince left Venice, he is travelling about
his territories, without ever stopping more than
three or four days in a place, in order to avoid
giving audience to the Spanish envoys, who are
waiting for him at Mantua, and to whom he has
sent word that they may address themselves to his
Council; that for himself, he has no answer to
give them to their propositions, because he is waiting
for intelligence from Vienna, by which he intends
to regulate his conduct. The Count Matthioli
went to him the beginning of this week, in
order to receive his instructions for his journey to
Paris, and to give him an account of his negociation
with the Republic. He will afterwards return
here to explain to the Senate his Master&#8217;s
sentiments; and so, Sir, I shall perhaps have a
further opportunity of deferring his departure for
a still longer <span class="nowrap">time.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p>I have nothing to add to what I have already
had the honour of writing to you, upon the affair
which regards the Duke of Mantua. I have received
this morning a note from the Count Matthioli,
in which he gives me intelligence that he
shall be here to-morrow; and that he will come
the same day to me, an hour after sunset. I will
not fail to give you an account, in my next letter,
of the conversation I shall have with him. I am
glad that he did not return to Venice so soon as he
originally intended; because his journey to Paris
will be, in consequence, deferred some days longer.
I will try to obtain intelligence why the Resident
from Mantua has had such frequent audiences of
the College for the last few days.</p>

<p class="abstract">Approval of Matthioli&#8217;s Mission to France.&mdash;Permission to
Estrades to leave Venice.</p>

<p class="date">April 5th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>We are now at the end of our journey, and consequently
at the end of my want of punctuality in
writing to you. The being stationary at St. Germain,
will make me more regular. I took an opportunity,
yesterday, to give an account to his
Majesty of your letters of the 5th, 12th, and 19th
of last month. He appeared satisfied with the
manner in which you have conducted the business
with the Duke of Mantua; and was made acquainted,
by your letter, written after your interview
with that prince, with the resolution he had
taken of sending the Count Matthioli to France.
You will have already seen by my despatches, that
there is little probability of his Majesty&#8217;s being able
to send a considerable army into Italy this year.
Now it appears, that the expectation of his sending
one, forms the foundation of all the designs which<a class="page" name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a>
the Duke of Mantua has communicated to you.
You must be aware, that it would answer no good
purpose to undeceive him; because this would be
to break off a negociation, which may otherwise
have considerable results. Therefore one of the
advantages of the journey of the Count Matthioli
is, that it gains time; besides, perhaps it may be
possible to remove difficulties, and take measures
with him in person, which might be difficult to be
arranged at a distance. Therefore, Sir, you will
see that, as the King cannot grant the principal conditions
which have been required, because they all
turn upon an action in Italy, we cannot flatter ourselves
with concluding any thing with this prince,
at present. This is what makes me think, that if
it is so particularly necessary for your interests, as
you say, to return to France, there is nothing that
need prevent your executing your wish. His
Majesty appears to me so much satisfied with your
services, that, though he has doubtless the intention
of making use of them in a sphere which will
give them a wider scope than Venice does, he will
willingly grant you leave of absence. I have even
already made him acquainted with your wish; and
it appears to me, that you are at liberty to do<a class="page" name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a>
what you choose; either to stay at Venice, or to
come to <span class="nowrap">Paris.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p class="abstract">Conversation with Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, April 9th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli arrived here six days ago;
I had a conversation with him the same evening,
and the day after he set off for Bologna, where he
was to meet the Duke of Mantua, who will send
him from thence to Paris, after having given him
his last orders. He assured me that he was
charged to confirm to his Majesty all that I have
had the honour of acquainting him with, and that<a class="page" name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a>
his master had only recommended him not to consent
to the putting a French garrison into Casale,
as long as he could fight it off. But, Sir, he told
me at the same time, that he saw too well that this
condition was the actual foundation of the proposed
treaty, to wish to raise a negociation respecting
it; and that he had made the Duke of Mantua
understand that it was necessary to act with good
faith towards the King, and not to balance about
giving him this security and satisfaction, if he
wished to attach himself to the interests of his
Majesty, as he had determined to do. I perceived
notwithstanding, though he did not speak openly
of it, that the example of Messina<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="footnote-anchor">194</a> had made
him reflect upon the consequences of the engagement
his master was about to make with the King,<a class="page" name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a>
which obliged me to represent to him how much
this fear was ill-founded, and what a difference
there was between a solemn treaty of two Sovereign
Princes, as the one we were now concerting
would be, and the assistance which his Majesty
had only given to the Messinese from pure generosity.</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli professed to be of my
opinion, and to have great joy at seeing affairs
as well-disposed as he could possibly have
wished.</p>

very much of the manner in which you<a class="page" name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a>
have carried on the negociation with the Duke of

<p class="abstract">Means of protracting the Negociation.&mdash;Views of Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, April 30th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I consider myself very happy, that the King has
so much approved of the manner in which I have
conducted myself, in the affair of the Duke of
Mantua, as you have informed me in the letter
which you did me the honour to write to me on
the 13th of this month, and that his Majesty has
had the goodness to regard more the zeal I have
for his service than my capacity. I shall have
nothing more in future to tell you on this subject,
but the Count Matthioli will give you ample information,
when he arrives at Court, of the sentiments
of his master; of the state of his affairs;
and of what may be expected from them. The
disposition in which I have seen him, makes me
hope that it will not be impossible to protract
this negociation, without running the risk of break<a class="page" name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a>ing
it off, until the season for action is past, and
that, when he shall see the necessity that there is
of waiting till the King can take measures for sending
an army into Italy, he will willingly employ
the influence he possesses over the mind of the
Duke of Mantua, to take from him all kind of suspicion,
and to prevent his being impatient at this
delay; perhaps even he might be able to persuade
his master, if he should really endeavour it, to put
himself under the declared protection of the King,
as he has thus far been under that of the House of
Austria; and to content himself with his Majesty&#8217;s
paying the garrison he intends to place in Casale.
Finally, Sir, this affair will be in such good hands,
since it is yourself that will manage it, that even
what appears the most difficult in it may very well
succeed. I will only add, that I know that the
Count Matthioli has a great desire, and need of
making his fortune, and that there are few things
to which his master would not consent for a considerable
sum of money, and from the hope of a
great employment; of which, in fact, the title alone
need be given to him; as was the case with the
Duke of Modena in the service of France, and with
the late Duke of Mantua in that of the Emperor,<a class="page" name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a>

<p>The Count Matthioli has been here for the last
four days with his master. He came to me yesterday,
to tell me that the Spaniards had been, for
the last two months, making such great advances
to the Duke of Mantua, that they would, perhaps,
have obliged him to consent to all they desired,
which was the removing his garrison from Guastalla,
introducing the Germans into Casale, and de<a class="page" name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a>claring
himself openly against France, if he had
separated himself for a single moment from him;
the Duchess-mother, and all the council of this
Prince, being devoted to the House of Austria.
That it was necessary he should wait for the
return of the Marquis Galerati from Milan, and
that he should remain, besides, three weeks or a
month with the Duke of Mantua, who was to go,
during that time, to Casale, where he had persuaded
him to wait for his return from France.
That, therefore, he could not set off till towards
the end of June, but that he would not delay
beyond that time. I answered him, that he had
been in the right to remain with his master, at a
time when his presence was so necessary to him;
that he ought not to set off on his journey to Paris,
till he was well assured that his absence would
cause no change, either in the sentiments or the
affairs of that Prince, but that I could assure him
the King would see him with pleasure, and that
he would receive every kind of satisfaction from
his <span class="nowrap">journey.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p>The Count Matthioli, who does not lose sight
of the Duke of Mantua, for the reasons that I
have already informed you of, is come here to
make a stay of three or four days with that
Prince; he has assured me that he is still in the
resolution of setting off, the end of this month, to
go to Paris; and that he will first accompany his
master to Casale, where he has lately discovered
the intrigues of the Spaniards, for the purpose of
obtaining possession of that place. I have taken
occasion, Sir, to represent to him, that, even if the
report, which has been spread of a general peace,
should be true, the Duke of Mantua would have
still more need of the King&#8217;s protection; that the
House of Austria will not be in a condition to do
injury to any Prince, as long as she shall have to
contend with the power of his Majesty; but that
if she had no longer this obstacle, it would be easy<a class="page" name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a>
for her to execute the designs, which his master
could not doubt her having against him; that it was
greatly his interest to put himself in such a state,
that he need not fear being deprived of Casale
and the Montferrat, of which the Court of Vienna
had declared its wish to put the Empress Eleanor
in possession, who had no other view than that of
leaving it some day to the Prince of Lorrain,<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="footnote-anchor">199</a> in
favour of his marriage with the widow of the King of
Poland; that the Duke of Mantua could not avoid
this misfortune, except by procuring for himself
the support of the King, by means of an intimate
connection of interests; as would be that he would
have with him, if his Majesty had a garrison in
Casale, which would be paid at his expense, and
kept on the same conditions as we had already
agreed upon; that this would make him the more
secure, from the circumstance of his Majesty&#8217;s
never having had any claims upon his territories,
and from his being the only sovereign who was
capable of defending them successfully against<a class="page" name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a>
those, who thought they had well-grounded claims
upon them. I added to this, that if he reflected
upon what I told him, he would, without doubt,
perceive, that the Duke of Mantua could not take
a better line, than the one that I proposed to him.
The Count Matthioli answered me, that he was so
persuaded of this, and that he was so assured of
the aversion which that Prince had for the Spaniards,
and of his inclination towards France, that
even if at his arrival at Court he should find the
peace concluded and published, and that there
should be in consequence no more hope of seeing
the war in the Milanese, which his master so much
wished for there, he would still not hesitate to
conclude in his name the affair which we have
commenced here, provided the King wished for it.
Should this agree with his Majesty&#8217;s designs, you,
Sir, will know better than any body how to make
use of the good intentions of the Count Matthioli,
when he shall be with you.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I answer your letters of the 21st and 28th of
May, and of the 4th of this month together; the
first has made known to the King the reasons
which have delayed the Count Matthioli: if they
are really such as he told you, and that he has
thought his presence necessary, in order to prevent
the injurious resolutions to which the Spaniards
might have persuaded his master, it is quite
right in him not to have left him; it would also
be advantageous if he could soon withdraw him
from Mantua, and lead him to Casale. It will
then be more easy for him to make his journey
into France, and to insure the success of the
measures which he has concerted with you.</p>

<p>The King has seen the letter which you were
pleased to write to me, and his Majesty has learnt
from it with pleasure, that the Count Matthioli is
always in the same sentiments of affection and zeal,
which he has already shown for his Majesty.
Continue to strengthen him in them, by the hope
of the same advantages which you have already
shown him that the Duke his master will find in
the alliance and protection of the King. The Duke
not being in a condition to preserve Casale, without
the assistance of some one more powerful than
himself, he cannot certainly receive it more usefully
and more surely than from the hands of his
Majesty. I trust you will labour, as you have
already done, to inspire him with the desire of it,
from the pleasure that you will have in rendering
a very agreeable service to his Majesty.</p>

<p class="abstract">Differences between the Duke of Mantua and the
Spaniards.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, July 2, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I see by the letter, which you did me the honour
to write to me on the 15th of last month, that you
have approved of the assiduity of the Count Matthioli
about the Duke of Mantua, from the reasons
which I sent you. It will appear to you still
more useful, when you are told that he has obliged
that Prince to break off the marriage of the great-nephew
of Don Vincent of Gonzaga, Viceroy of
Sicily, with the second daughter of the late Duke
of Guastalla, and sister of the Duchess of Mantua,
which was already concluded, and which had been
contrived by the Spaniards, in the view of putting
him more easily in possession of the Duchy of Guastalla;
so that the Duke of Mantua is at present
so much at variance with the Spaniards, that it is
not difficult to make him comprehend that there<a class="page" name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a>
is no other safe part for him to take, than that of
putting himself under the protection of the King,
and of fulfilling those engagements with his Majesty,
which he has already agreed upon. This
is what I represented to the Count Matthioli at
his last visit to this place, and he was the more
easily brought to be of this opinion, because he
has a great interest that this affair should succeed,
since the Spaniards, who are all-powerful in the
councils of his master, and who have the Duchess-mother
on their side, have easily discovered that
it is he alone who injures them in the mind of
the Duke, and would not fail to take vengeance
on him, if he ever fell into their hands. He departed
yesterday to go and join the Duke of Mantua,
whom he does not quit, and whom he is to
accompany to Mantua, and afterwards to Casale,
from whence he will proceed to Paris: but, by
the reckoning that we have made together, he
cannot be there before the end of the next month.</p>

<p>After what I had the honour of acquainting
you with in my last letter, on the subject of the
Count Matthioli, I should not have any thing
further to add to-day, if he had not begged me
to let you know that he has only remained at
Venice some days longer than he originally intended,
in order to execute some little commissions
which the Duke of Mantua gave him when he left
the place; but that he will go and meet that Prince<a class="page" name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a>
this week at Mantua, that he will follow him to
Casale, and that from thence he will set off to
go to Paris, where he expects to arrive during
the month of September. We have together calculated
the time, and he cannot and ought not
to leave his master sooner. He has, however,
been apprehensive that these delays might give
a bad opinion of him, and he has wished, in
order to set his mind at rest, that I would send
you the letters he has written to the King and
to you, Sir; although I assured him he need not
take this trouble, and that it would be sufficient if
I bore testimony to his zeal and to his good <span class="nowrap">intentions.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p>The illness, which came upon me while I was
getting ready for my departure, has, (as your Ma<a class="page" name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a>jesty
has deigned to be informed by the Abbé
d&#8217;Estrades, your Ambassador at Venice,) occasioned,
to my extreme grief, the necessity for me to
delay my journey to you. The eagerness I have
is extraordinary, to be able with all possible celerity
to throw myself at your Majesty&#8217;s feet. As
soon as I shall have recovered in some degree my
strength, I will not fail to set off. The present
emergency of the Genoese seems to me very opportune
for the designs we have in view. I hope
to be able, with all respect, to suggest upon this
subject also to your Majesty some points of importance.
I bow myself before you most humbly.</p>

he intended to continue his journey into France.
The uneasiness he felt at the delay of the Count
Matthioli in his departure, (although it only proceeded
from his illness, and from the necessity he
had to be near his master,) and his desire to see
him set off before him, or at least at the same time,
are the causes why he has always deferred his own
departure; but having had four days ago a conference
with the Count Matthioli, in which he assured

the aforesaid Sieur Giuliani to be to-morrow evening
at Verona, in order to continue his journey to the

order to keep the whole affair as secret as possible,
to take him with him rather than any other, as he
is already informed of all the circumstances of the

<p>The Count Matthioli, will instruct you so
particularly, both of the manner in which he
has acquitted himself of the orders with which
you have charged him for me, and of the extreme
satisfaction with which I have received the
assurances he has given me of your zeal for my
interests, that I can have nothing further to add
upon these subjects. I am only desirous of testifying
to you myself, the entire confidence which
I wish you to place in my friendship. You may
promise yourself, that it will be useful and glorious
to you upon all occasions; and you may always
rely with certainty and security upon my alliance.
I hope to be able to give you very evident marks
of this in the sequel; and after having borne testimony
to you of the satisfaction which the conduct
of the Count Matthioli, through the whole of this
affair, has given me, I will not lengthen the pre<a class="page" name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a>sent

<p class="abstract">Interview of Pinchesne with Don Joseph Varano.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, December 24th, 1678.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>As soon as I had received, together with the
letter that you did me the favour to write me on
the second of this month, that which the Count
Matthioli sent to the Duke of Mantua, under
cover to Don Joseph Varano, who is here with
that Prince, and who is one of the two persons
to whom his Highness has confided the design he
has to deliver Casale into the hands of the King,
I made known to M. Varano, by the son of the
Sieur Giuliani, that I was very desirous of being
able to deliver to him a letter from a French gentleman,
who was one of his friends, and who had
begged me to give it into his own hands. He understood
very well what that meant to say; and
at the same time sent me word, that if I would
find myself that evening in mask at the Opera, he
would not fail to be there also; which was exe<a class="page" name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a>cuted
according to our resolution. He told me,
when I gave it him, that the Duke of Mantua
would be delighted to receive it; because, for some
days, he had shown great impatience to hear of the
arrival of the Count Matthioli at the court, and to
know in what state the affair was, which he was
gone there to negociate. He asked me, at the same
time, if I could not give him some news upon the
subject; but as I know nothing about it, I contented
myself with only telling him that I did not
doubt but it was in a good train, and that I was
persuaded his Highness would receive, on this occasion,
the marks of that esteem and friendship
which His Majesty has for him. I thought, Sir,
I might be permitted to speak to him in these
terms; because what I told him was from my
own head, and not as if I had received any order
to that effect. We afterwards agreed together,
that, during the stay of the Duke of Mantua at
Venice, we would make use of the same means to
deliver to him the letters which might come to me
from the Count <span class="nowrap">Matthioli.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p class="date">Venice, Jan. 21st, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Before I received the letter, which you did me the
honour to write to me on the 30th of last month,
and by which you informed me that the King intended
to send here the Count d&#8217;Asfeld, Colonel of
a regiment of Dragoons, he was already arrived,
and had been to see me, to communicate to me
the orders he had received from his Majesty; but<a class="page" name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a>
as he was not charged with any letter from you,
for me, I should have had some difficulty in opening
my plans to him, in an affair of this consequence,
if M. Giuliani, who happened to be with
me just then, and who was come to see me for the
first time since his return, had not told me, a few
moments before, that there would shortly arrive here
a gentleman from the King; and if I had not found
him himself so well-informed of the whole of this
affair, that I could have no doubt of the truth of
what he told me; since it appeared to me impossible
that he could know so much upon the subject
without having learnt it from you, or from those who
are alone acquainted with it. He told me that M.
de Louvois had obliged him, before his departure,
to burn the letter which you had given him to deliver
to me, from fear lest, if he was stopped in the
Milanese, it might give some ground of suspicion
to the Spaniards. He even detailed to me so precisely
all that it contained, that I could have
no farther cause for fear, after I had seen that
what he told me, tallied so well with all that you
have done me the favour to write to me upon his
subject. We have not been able to agree upon any
thing together since he has been here, because the<a class="page" name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a>
Count Matthioli is not yet arrived; but as he has
written to me and to M. Giuliani, from whom he separated
himself near Turin, in order to excite less
observation, that he will be here in a few days, I
hope to be able, by the next post, to give you an account
of all we shall have settled with him. I will
not fail, Sir, to represent strongly to him, according
to the order which M. d&#8217;Asfeld has given me, on the
part of the King, to that effect, that it is absolutely
necessary for the Duke of Mantua to be at Casale
by the 20th of next month, to make the exchange
of the treaties; and I will make him so clearly understand
that diligence is most necessary in an
affair of this importance, lest, from delay, it should
be discovered, that I am almost bold enough to promise,
that he will persuade his master to go there
at that time. However, Sir, if this prince, who is
accustomed to pass the last days of the Carnival
here every year, wished also to do so this year, in
order not to make his conduct appear extraordinary;
and that he should think that from the 15th
of February, which is the first day of Lent, to the
20th, there will be too little time for his journey
to Casale, without showing an anxiety which might
occasion suspicions; and that, therefore, he might<a class="page" name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a>
wish to defer for some days the exchange of the
treaties, I think you will approve of my sending
you an extraordinary courier to inform you of it;
it being impossible for me to do so sufficiently
quickly by the post.</p>

of a slight illness which the Duchess dowager<a class="page" name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a>
of Mantua has had, which has obliged that prince
to remain with her; but the Sieur Giuliani has
received to-day a letter from Don Joseph Varano,
in which he informs him, that the Count Matthioli
is at present at Padua, where he is waiting for the
Duke of Mantua, in order that they may come here
together, on Monday, or Tuesday at the latest.
This has obliged M. d&#8217;Asfeld and myself to send
Giuliani this evening to Padua, to the Count
Matthioli, to give him intelligence of the arrival of
M. d&#8217;Asfeld at Venice, and to represent to him
that it is of the last importance, on account of the
shortness of the time, for us to have, as soon as
possible, a conference together, in order to take all
the measures that shall be necessary to induce the
Duke of Mantua to be at Casale the 20th or 25th
of next month, according to the wish of the King.</p>

<p>I think I can say to-day more securely than I
did last week, that I shall inform you by the next
post of all we shall have arranged with the Count
Matthioli, since certainly the next week will not
pass away without our meeting.</p>

<p>The Duke of Mantua has been here since
Tuesday. The Count Matthioli was to have
come with him, but the fever he has been suffering
from for the last ten or twelve days prevented
him, and obliged him to remain at Padua, where
he still is, for the purpose of going through a
course of remedies. Nevertheless, Sir, as time
presses, M. d&#8217;Asfeld and I have sent M. Giuliani
to him twice this week, to represent to him the
necessity we have of seeing him, to arrange together
the day when the Duke of Mantua is to be
at Casale. He has sent us word for answer, that
to-morrow he will certainly be at Venice, whatever
his state of health may be, and that on Monday or
Tuesday, at the latest, we may see one another, to<a class="page" name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a>
conclude all things; after which, M. d&#8217;Asfeld can
set off for Pignerol: that, besides, he could assure
us, that in all the conversations he had had with the
Duke of Mantua, since his return from France,
he had found that Prince in the best possible dispositions
for the success of the affair, within the
time that had been fixed upon with you, and that
he had even done himself the honour of acquainting
you with this in a letter which he had written
you. I have also seen, within the last two days,
Don Joseph Varano, who has also given me assurances
to the same effect on the part of his
master. So, Sir, there is every reason to hope,
that the King will soon receive the satisfaction
that he expects from this business. When M.
d&#8217;Asfeld and myself shall see the Count Matthioli,
we will represent to him the diligence that is
necessary to be made use of in this affair; which
is the more so, because the march of the troops
towards Pignerol begins to give suspicion to the
Spaniards in the Milanese, although thus far
they are persuaded that they are only sent to that
place to work at the fortifications. M. d&#8217;Asfeld,
who, as well as myself, is rendered uneasy by the
delay of the Count Matthioli, had made a resolu<a class="page" name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a>tion,
on Friday evening, to go and pay him a visit
at Padua, and to take as a pretext his wish to go
and see some of the towns of the Terra Ferma;
but we reflected, that two days, more or less, was
not of great consequence; and that, besides the
uselessness of this journey, since it is necessary
that the Count Matthioli should speak to the
Duke of Mantua before he can settle any thing
with us, it might also cause some suspicion in his
inn, where there are many strangers, if he was
seen to leave Venice during the time when the
diversions there are at their height, to go and
make a tour in towns where there are none.
Therefore we have thought, that it was better to
wait the arrival of the Count Matthioli in this
city, in order not to risk any thing by too much
precipitation, in an affair in which secrecy is so
necessary, and respecting which one can never take
too many precautions.</p>

PINCHESNE TO POMPONNE.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Interviews with Matthioli.&mdash;Further Delays in the Ratification
of the Treaty.</p>

<p class="date">Feb. 7th, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep"><span class="smcap">We</span> had hoped, M. d&#8217;Asfeld and I, according
to the promises which had been given us to this
effect by the Count Matthioli, through M. Giuliani,
as often as we sent him to Padua, that we
might be able to dispose the Duke of Mantua to
go to Casale the 25th of this month, according
to the King&#8217;s intentions; but notwithstanding all
that we have been able to allege to the Count in
the two conferences we have had with him, last<a class="page" name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a>
Thursday and this morning, we have not been
able to succeed, and we have therefore been obliged
to defer the day of the exchange of the
ratifications of the treaty till the 10th of next
March; on which day the Duke of Mantua promises
to be, most assuredly, and without any further
delay, at Casale.</p>

<p>We have despatched you this extraordinary
courier, Sir, to give you intelligence of this; and
we have so strongly recommended diligence to
him, that we hope our letters will still arrive soon
enough at court, to afford the King sufficient time
to give whatever orders his Majesty shall judge
necessary, for the delaying of the march of the
troops towards Pignerol.</p>

<p>M. d&#8217;Asfeld writes in this intention, to M. de
Louvois; but I will take the liberty to request
you, Sir, in case the King has any new orders
to give us on this affair, to order them to be sent
directly to me; because, as it is possible that
M. d&#8217;Asfeld may be obliged to depart before they
arrive, I could not be made acquainted with
them if they were sent to him, the cypher he has
received from M. de Louvois being different to<a class="page" name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a>
that which you have sent me. We think, nevertheless,
we can assure you, Sir, that we do not see,
from this delay of time, any reason to doubt the
sincerity of the sentiments of the Duke of Mantua;
who has again assured us, through the Count
Matthioli, that he is more than ever in the intention
of executing the treaty he has just made
with his Majesty, and of keeping the promise he
has given to him.</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli had written to you; but
as his letter was not in cypher, and did not contain
any thing but what I have sent you word of in
this, I have not thought it necessary to send it
to you.</p>

were under a week ago, of sending off in all haste<a class="page" name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a>
the courier whom we despatched to the Court,
prevented me, Sir, from being able to acquaint
you in the letter, which I then did myself the
honour to write to you, with the reasons, which
the Count Matthioli has alleged to us, to make us
understand that the Duke of Mantua cannot be
at Casale the 25th of this month, according to the
wishes of the King expressed to him by us. He
told us three: the first was, that this Prince, wishing
to send to Casale, as soon as he should be
arrived there, his guards and the greater part of
his court, (intending to make some stay there after
the conclusion of the affair,) it became necessary
for him for this purpose to have some money,
which could not be got in so short a time. The
second, that it was absolutely necessary first to
persuade Don Vincent Gonzaga,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="footnote-anchor">247</a> who is at present
at Mantua, to make this journey with his
Highness, since, being the presumptive heir of
the Duke of Mantua, it would be very dangerous
to leave him at Mantua, at the time when the
affair of Casale would be known; because the
Mantuans regarding him as likely to be their
future sovereign, there would be danger that they<a class="page" name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a>
might allow themselves to be persuaded by him to
rebel against the Duke of Mantua, which, without
doubt, he would not fail to try to make them do,
when he should see that his Highness was attaching
himself to the party of France, and abandoning
that of the House of Austria, to which Don Vincent
is absolutely devoted. And the third, the obligation
under which the Duke of Mantua found himself of
holding here a sort of carousel with several Venetian
gentlemen, to whom he had given his promise
to that effect, which he could not now retract,
without occasioning some suspicion here. This
last reason, Sir, although the least considerable of
the three, appears to me notwithstanding to be a
truer one than the others; because this Prince is so
much attached to all pleasures, of whatever kind
they may be, that when he finds an occasion of indulging
in them, the most important affairs cannot
turn him away from them. This little carousel is
certainly to take place some day next week; after
which the Count Matthioli has assured us that the
Duke of Mantua will, without doubt, leave this
place, in order to be at Casale the 10th of next
month, as he has promised us; his people are even
to set off to-day to return to Mantua. To-morrow<a class="page" name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a>
we are to have another conference with the Count
Matthioli, to regulate in what manner M. d&#8217;Asfeld
is to open the business at Casale with the Duke of
Mantua, for the purpose of making the exchange
of the ratifications of the treaty. Meanwhile, Sir,
I think it right to inform you, that the march of
the troops to Pignerol, and the munitions and money
which are carried there, cause great fear through
the whole of Italy; and that it is said publicly
here, that the King has some great plan, without
its being possible to penetrate what it is, suspicions
falling upon Casale, upon Geneva, upon
Savoy, and more particularly upon the Republic
of Genoa, on account of what has lately passed
there: I even know that M. Contarini<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="footnote-anchor">248</a> has
written in these terms to Venice. There are also
two couriers, arrived during the last eight or ten
days from Turin, at Milan; the one despatched by
<i>Madame Royale</i><a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="footnote-anchor">249</a> to her envoy, and the other by
the Duke of Gioninazze<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="footnote-anchor">250</a> to the government of<a class="page" name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a>
Milan, to give them intelligence of these movements.
The Count Matthioli has told us, that the
Duke of Mantua intended to make an excuse for
his journey to Casale, by saying, that the fear he is
in of the designs of France, obliges him to go to
that place, to give the necessary orders for its
security. I have just now learnt, that a courier is
arrived to the Spanish Ambassador from Milan.
I am persuaded he is sent for the same reasons
I have before stated.</p>

by the King&#8217;s order; which makes it be believed
more than ever, that his Majesty certainly meditates
some great design on that side, although the
strongest suspicion falls always on Genoa, and,
next to that, on Casale. The Spanish Ambassador,
and the Abbé Frederic, the resident of the
Emperor, went together on Wednesday to the
Duke of Mantua, to tell him they had heard from<a class="page" name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a>
Turin that he wished to give Casale and the
Montferrat to the King, and to represent to him
the disadvantages that would arise to all Italy
from this measure, and particularly to the House
of Austria, on account of the Duchy of Milan.
That Prince answered them that he was astonished
they could believe in reports of this nature,
which had no solid foundation. This answer was
all they could draw from him on the subject.
Nevertheless, Sir, as he is always in the intention
of executing the treaty he has made with the
King, which he has again assured us through the
Count Matthioli, M. d&#8217;Asfeld and I have had
two more conferences this week with the aforesaid
Count, the last of which was yesterday evening;
in which we arranged that M. d&#8217;Asfeld and he
should find themselves on the 9th of next month
at Notre-Dame d&#8217;Incréa, which is a village ten
miles from Casale, in order to make there the exchange
of the ratifications; and that the Duke of
Mantua should arrive without fail at Casale on the
evening of the 15th, to wait there for the troops
of his Majesty, and to put them in possession of
the place when they should arrive there on the<a class="page" name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a>
18th, which is the day that M. d&#8217;Asfeld has said
they would be there, having, according to the order
of M. de Louvois, demanded nine days between
that of the exchange of the ratifications and
that of their arrival at Casale. M. d&#8217;Asfeld left
this place yesterday after this conference to go to
Pignerol, and the Count Matthioli is to set off
this evening for Incréa: but as the Duke of Mantua
wishes to remain only a single day at Mantua,
and intends to travel post to Casale, he will remain
here till the 11th or 12th of next month: it
is even better he should do so, because as long as
they shall see him amusing himself here with a
carousel and similar trifles, there will be less suspicion
of him than if they saw him take his <span class="nowrap">departure.&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8727;</span></p>

<p>All the advices that come from France and
from Turin declare so positively that the Duke of
Mantua has made a treaty with the King for the
cession of Casale and of the Montferrat, that they
are beginning here to change into certainties those
suspicions which I mentioned to you, Sir, in my two
last letters, they had had, ever since the first news
arrived at Milan by the couriers which Madame
Royale and the Duke of Gioninazze despatched
there. The Governor of Milan immediately sent
two others to Madrid and Vienna to give intelligence
to the Emperor and the King of Spain. The
courier, who was sent to Vienna, returned here on
Wednesday evening, with express orders to the
Marquis Canozza, the Imperial Vicar, in Italy, to<a class="page" name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a>
speak strongly to the Duke of Mantua, and to try
and deter him from doing a thing so contrary to
the interests of the whole House of Austria; and
to go afterwards to Turin and Milan, to concert
there the means of preventing it, in case the news
proved true. This same Marquis Canozza having
been, for the last five or six months, in the prisons
of Venice, accused of having had a gentleman of
Verona assassinated, the Emperor has also written
by the same Courier to the Republic, to beg that
he may be enlarged, which was done on Thursday
evening. He has not been able as yet to see the
Duke of Mantua, who defers, as much as he can,
giving him audience, in order to gain time. The
fear I have been in, Sir, lest what he has to say
to this Prince, from the Emperor, might be capable
of producing some change in him, has obliged
me to charge M. Giuliani to go, as from me, to Don
Joseph Varano, who is at present, since the departure
of Count Matthioli, the only confidant of the
Duke of Mantua, to try to know from him what
are the sentiments of his master upon the subject
of this mission. He has answered me, that his
master would assuredly execute the treaty he has
made with His Majesty, notwithstanding the ob<a class="page" name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a>stacles
which the House of Austria puts in the
way of it, and that he would leave this place on
Wednesday or Thursday, in order to arrive at
Casale within the time at which he has promised
to be there. All that we have to fear is, that
the Spaniards, who are extremely suspicious, may
watch him, and oppose his passage,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="footnote-anchor">255</a> and that of
the Count Matthioli, of whom they have an equal

PINCHESNE TO POMPONNE.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Arrest of d&#8217;Asfeld.&mdash;Departure of the Duke of Mantua
from Venice.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, March 11th, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The Courier, whom we sent you a month ago,
not having complied with the order I had given<a class="page" name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a>
him to write to me as soon as he should be arrived
at Lyons, in order to acquaint me whether he
had passed through the Milanese without being
arrested, I was under great uneasiness until I received
the letter, in which you do me the favour
to inform me that you have received the despatch
which I sent you by him. You may believe, Sir,
that when M. d&#8217;Asfeld and I were obliged to defer
the day of the exchange of the ratifications till
the 10th of this month, we did not do so, till we
saw that it was impossible to persuade the Duke
of Mantua to perform his part within the period
desired by the King.</p>

<p>All the world says here, that he is to go away
this evening, or to-morrow, without his suite; and
he has always told us, through the Count Matthioli,
that when he left this place, he would only
pass through Mantua, and travel post from thence
to Casale. He has still more time than is necessary
for him to be there before the 18th of this
month, which is the day when the troops of the
King are to enter the place, according to what we
agreed upon with the Count Matthioli.</p>

<p>M. Giuliani has received a letter from him<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="footnote-anchor">257</a> this<a class="page" name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a>
week, in which he writes him word that M. d&#8217;Asfeld
has been arrested at La Canonica, which is a
village beyond Bergamo, but that he was released
shortly after.</p>

<p>I do not know, Sir, if this news is really true, it
having been impossible for me to verify it, and the
Count Matthioli only writing word of it because
a <i>Voiturier</i>, whom he met on the road, told him
that a gentleman whom he had conducted three or
four days ago from Verona to La Canonica, had
been arrested at the latter place, and released
afterwards. In any case, I cannot doubt but that
you are already informed of it, since the Count
mentions, in the same letter, that it has been written
to the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, who will not certainly
have failed to make you acquainted with it.</p>

<p>The King has been informed by the Sieur de
Pinchesne, of all the measures which you have
taken with him and with M. d&#8217;Asfeld, for the execution
of the affair, which has been conducted by
your labours, and of the time which the Duke of
Mantua has arranged for being at Casale. He
is, besides, aware that M. d&#8217;Asfeld was to leave
Venice some days earlier, according to the agreement
that you had made together; but as he<a class="page" name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a>
learns by his letters from Piedmont, that it is very
possible he may have been arrested in his passage
through the Milanese, and placed in the Castle of
Milan, he has judged it right to supply his place
with the person who will deliver you this letter;
it is the same whom he has honoured principally
with his confidence for the execution and the conduct
of all that shall be to be done with you and the
Duke of Mantua, after the arrival of that Prince
at Casale. Therefore you will, if you please,
place entire confidence in him, and particularly
in the assurances which he will give you of the
good-will of his Majesty for you, and of his sense
of the service you are rendering to him.</p>

ESTRADES TO MATTHIOLI.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Complaints of the Delays in the Conclusion of the Negociation.</p>

<p class="date">Turin, March 24th, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep">I have thought it my duty, Sir, to give you
advice of my arrival at this court, in order that
you may be able to let me know whatever you
shall judge necessary; and that whatsoever remains
to be done, for the termination of what has
been already resolved, may be the more easy of
execution, from the proximity of the places at
which we respectively are. You cannot doubt its
being with this view, that the wish has been expressed
for my coming here; and I have been the
more glad to come, because I hoped that I should
not be long without seeing the effect of the engagements
which you have entered into with the
king. If I was not aware of your probity and of
your zeal for the interests of His Majesty, and for
the advantage of the Prince to whom you are attached,
I should have been dreadfully uneasy at the<a class="page" name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a>
delay of our affair, which ought without fail, and
at the latest, to have been concluded at the commencement
of this month. But though we are already
at the 24th, and that all you can desire on
our part is entirely ready, I cannot persuade myself
that the intentions of his Highness and your
own are other than they always were. You have
been so well aware, how much this affair would
be useful to him at present, and glorious for the
future, and you have made him so well comprehend
this, that I cannot have any suspicions on
this head; neither can I, when I represent to
myself the very considerable interest you have in
completing an affair of this importance, of which
the conclusion will be considered so great a merit
on your part in the eyes of the most generous and
the greatest King in the world, who has testified
to you himself the good-will he bears you for it;
who has praised the address with which you have
conducted the negociation; who has begun by
giving you several marks of his esteem and liberality;
and who has promised you besides such
great advantages as would be sufficient to establish
all your family, and to make you happy for the
rest of your days. As his word has always been<a class="page" name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a>
inviolable, you no doubt rely upon it implicitly:
you must be aware, also, how dangerous it would be
to deceive him, and that, after all the steps he has
taken, and the measures he has agreed upon, you
would expose his Highness, and yourself, to very
great misfortunes, if his Majesty had reason to
think that bad faith had been made use of towards
him, after a treaty concluded in all the proper
forms with himself, and founded upon a full power;
the inexecution of which would only serve to
ruin a Prince, who abandons himself to your councils,
and who would be infallibly stripped by the
Spaniards, who would be willing once for all to
deliver themselves from the alarms which they
have received from the reports spread about on
all sides respecting this affair. I have already
told you, Sir, that I believe you as well-intentioned
as ever, and that it is not for the purpose
of exciting you to return to these good sentiments,
or to strengthen them, that I speak to you in this
manner; but only lest a longer delay should diminish
the good opinion entertained of you, and
lest umbrage should be taken that an affair in
which secrecy was so important, has been made
public, although the King, and those who have<a class="page" name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a>
the honour to serve him, have kept the secret so
well that it cannot have been got at through them.
I hope, nevertheless, that we shall soon be satisfied;
and that I shall have the pleasure to see
you worthily recompensed for your zeal: I assure
you, Sir, that your interest, more than my own,
though I have much in this affair, makes me desirous
of it.</p>

of the affair of the Duke of Mantua. We have
heard nothing from M. d&#8217;Asfeld, and, therefore,
can have no doubt of his being prisoner in the
Milanese. The news which you received of his
being arrested at La Canonica, was doubtless as
true as that of his being released again was the
reverse. We shall now see if the firmness of the
Duke of Mantua, which has thus far resisted the
efforts of the Count Carrossa, and of the Republic
of Venice, will continue to the end: we cannot be
long without having this point cleared up, if, as
you mention in your letter of the 11th, he had set

parts. These reports also mention the days on<a class="page" name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a>
which he has gone out of the citadel, and the spot
where the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades came to speak to him
the last time from Turin. I have answered nothing
when I have heard these things said, except
that I knew of no one in the citadel, and nothing
upon the subject.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Saint-Maurice told several
people that the French Ambassador wished to be
very cunning; but that <i>he</i> knew very well that
there had been a treaty made between the King
and the Duke of Mantua, on the subject of Casale;
and that he also knew that during the last
ten days it had been absolutely broken off. The
retrograde movements of the troops cantoned in the
Briançonnois and the valley of Chaumont, on the
side of Dauphiny and Provence, seem to confirm
the report of the Marquis of Saint-Maurice; but
the arrival of the battalion of the regiment of
Piedmont in this town two days ago, makes the
people of the country, who love to reason upon
every thing, suspend their judgments; their reasonings
will be of no importance, if the Duke&#8217;s
sentiments are always well-disposed, for between
this place and Casale there is no fortress, nor any<a class="page" name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a>
obstacle which can delay the march of the King&#8217;s
troops.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The roads being good, and the days as long as
they are at present, a body of cavalry can go in
less than thirty hours from Pignerol to Casale.
There is no fortified place through which we
should be obliged to pass, and I am not aware of
any difficulty that we could find on the passage,
provided we took the country by surprise in our
march. I have thought it right to state this to
you, Sir, because the possibility of using this degree
of diligence may materially assist the mea<a class="page" name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a>sures
you may wish to take. The Duke of Mantua
has never been at Casale, which seems to me
an obstacle to the finding good excuses for his going
there, at a time when his conduct is so much
watched and suspected. But we could do very
well without him, if he is always well-intentioned,
and if he is the master of a good part of his garrison.
The Governor is of Mantua, and therefore
his actual subject; which is perhaps a favourable
circumstance.</p>

<p>M. d&#8217;Herleville must have received some letters
from Paris by the last post, which have given him<a class="page" name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a>
the suspicion that I might be here; at least, he
has put some leading questions on the subject to
M. de Chanois: he is not a man without curiosity,
and he thought by these means to gain certain
intelligence. As I have been now a long while
absent, and there has been no doubt at Paris
of some design in agitation in these parts, on
account of the troops which have been sent here,
it is probable that some reasoner of the regiment
of Guards, or some other person, may have given
him this idea.</p>

<p>I did myself the honour to send you word, Sir,
of all that passed in my journey to Incréa. I
have received letters from the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, in
which he informs me that the troops have retired a
little, in order to get into quarters where they can
subsist more conveniently; and also of the accounts
he has received respecting the delay in the execution
of the affair you are acquainted with. I am
treated here with so much attention and civility,
that a long residence, while waiting for intelligence,
ought not to give me any impatience, nor
can I complain of any, except that which is caused
by my anxiety and zeal to see the conclusion of an
affair which His Majesty is anxious about, and for<a class="page" name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a>
the conduct of which you, Sir, have thought proper
to honour me with your confidence. I should
have some uneasiness at being for so long a time
a burden and an inconvenience to M. de Saint-Mars;
but he executes with so much pleasure the
orders which he receives from you, that all the
care he takes of me does not distress me. I receive
it all as a very evident mark of the kindness
with which you, Sir, write to him on my subject,
for which I am infinitely obliged to you; as well
as for the honour you do me in permitting me to
remain, with all the respect that is due to you,</p>

<p class="abstract">Arrest of Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, May 3d, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep"><span class="smcap">I arrested</span> Matthioli yesterday, three miles
from hence, upon the King&#8217;s territories, during
an interview which the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades had ingeniously
contrived between him, Matthioli, and
myself, to facilitate the scheme. For the purpose
of arresting him, I only made use of the Chevalier
de Saint-Martin and de Villebois, two officers of
M. de Saint-Mars, and of four men of his company:
it was effected without any violence, and no
one knows the name of the rascal, not even the
officers who assisted in his arrest: he is in the
chamber which the individual named Dubreuil
occupied, where he will be treated civilly, according
to the request of the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, until
the wishes of the King, with regard to him, are
known. I do not write any thing to you, Sir, respecting
the certain conviction we have acquired
of the villanies of this man, the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades
having already given his Majesty all the information<a class="page" name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a>
possible upon this subject. In the interview we
had together before his arrest, we talked of various
things, and among others of the place in which
he had placed the essential and original papers
respecting the affair in question, which consist in
a letter of the Duke of Mantua to the King, the
full powers he himself had for negociating, the
treaty of his Majesty, executed by M. de Pomponne,
the ratification of the aforesaid treaty signed
by the Duke of Mantua, and a letter of the
Duke of Mantua to the Governor of Casale, ordering
him to receive the troops of the King in
conformity with the treaty. All these papers are
in a box at Bologna, in the hands of his wife, who
is retired into the convent of the Nuns of Saint
Lewis. The Abbé d&#8217;Estrades is of opinion that
no time should be lost in obtaining these papers.
As I only brought this man here yesterday very
late, and that the post goes early this morning, I
have not as yet had any conversation with him,
for the purpose of obtaining his papers; but two
hours hence I will go to his room, and I do not
doubt the menaces I shall make to him, which
his criminal conduct will render more terrific to
him, will oblige him to do all that I wish. I have<a class="page" name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a>
chosen M. de Blainvilliers, a choice approved of
also by M. de Saint-Mars, to go to Bologna,
considering him as very capable to conduct himself
well in such a business. I will try to give
him a route by which he will avoid passing over
the territories of the King of Spain. I will give
an account to you, Sir, the next post, of all that I
shall have done on this subject with Matthioli, to
whom I have given here the name of Lestang, no
one here knowing who he really is.</p>

<p class="abstract">Intelligence respecting Matthioli&#8217;s Papers.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, May 6th, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Since I did myself the honour of writing to you,
I have taken down shortly in writing all the information
I have been able to draw from the<a class="page" name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a>
Sieur de Lestang. By making him perceive, and
roughly too, the misery to which his bad conduct
exposed him, I induced him to seek for the means
of avoiding it, by doing readily and frankly all that
was desired of him. I have not said any thing to
him which could make him discover the means by
which we have been so certainly informed of his
treachery; but I have spoken to him in such a
manner on that subject, that he cannot doubt
that we know it, and are convinced of it. He is
a rascal; but I believe him to be honest in his
desire of delivering up the papers, either from the
fear which his present condition causes him, or
with the view of rendering a service to the King,
which may be agreeable to him, and may make him
forget what is past. The original papers are at
Padua, concealed in a hole in the wall of a room,
which is in his father&#8217;s lodging, and which he says
is known to him alone. These papers are the
treaty made by M. de Pomponne, signed by him
and by Matthioli, signed below by the Duke of
Mantua, a blank being left for the insertion of the
ratification, when the exchange should be made for
that of the King; a blank paper signed by the
Duke of Mantua, intended for a letter to the Go<a class="page" name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a>vernor
of Casale, to order him to receive the troops
of the King; the full power given to M. de Pomponne
to treat with him respecting Casale; and a
list of the troops destined to the execution of this
affair. If we once have possession of these papers,
the affair is concluded as far as regards negociation;
but this is a fact that we need only make
known when we think proper. As I am aware of
what importance it is to have possession of these
original papers, I have acquainted the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades
with the expedients I thought might be made
use of for this purpose, in order that I may be
assisted by his advice. I do not detail them at
present to you, Sir, because I expect to-day the
Sieur Giuliani, whom the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades is to
send to me, together with the Abbé de Montesquiou,
his relation, for the purpose of the former&#8217;s
being confronted with the Sieur de Lestang. As
this interview will probably suggest to me more
certain means of getting possession of these papers,
I will not, as yet, acquaint you, Sir, with those that
I had proposed to myself. There are, besides,
other papers at Bologna, which are only letters
and papers we have, as it seems to me, little need<a class="page" name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a>
of; knowing, as we do, by the list of those which
are at Padua, that it is these alone which particularly
regard the affair in question. I will do
myself the honour to send you word, Sir, by the
next post, what shall have been the issue of the
interview between the Sieur de Lestang and Giuliani.</p>

<p>The Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, by his care and address,
has found means to send to Pignerol the servant
of the Sieur de Lestang, with his goods and
all his papers. I have made an inventory of the
latter; they consist in tables of cyphers, and letters,
which I have docketted, and extracted the
substance of; they are of no importance. I will
send to you, Sir, by the next post, a copy of what
I have extracted, and a short summary of what I
have been able to learn from the Sieur de Lestang
in the conversations that I have had with him;
respecting which he tells me he has already sent
information to the King, or to the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades,
which has diminished the impatience I
should otherwise have had of acquainting you,
Sir, with them. M. de Saint-Mars treats the
Sieur de Lestang very kindly in all that regards<a class="page" name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a>
cleanliness and food; but very rigorously in preventing
him from holding intercourse with any
one</p>

he intended to make a present of to M. de Varengeville,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="footnote-anchor">277</a>
the new ambassador at Venice; and of his
intention to write to the Governor of Navarre the
news of what should happen in the affairs regarding
Casale.</p>

<p>7. A note, stating that the Marquis de Rebouf
can give intelligence to the King of what passes at
Genoa; and his reasons to the Marquis de Cavetto
for the pretensions to Savona.</p>

<p>8. Another, stating that the Duke of Mantua
had taken poison on the 22d of February, at<a class="page" name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a>
Venice, which was suspected to have been given
him by an individual, named George Hacquet,
a man about his person, and the minister of his
pleasures.</p>

<p>9. Another memorandum, by which it appears
that the Duke of Mantua received, on the 14th of
January, 2,500 pistoles from his mother; and on
the 10th of February, 3,000 pistoles from the
Abbé Frederic, the resident of the Emperor at
Venice; also containing an account of the communication
which he, the Sieur de Lestang, has with
the Governor of Casale.</p>

<p>10. Memorandum, by which it appears that he
had an interview, on the 26th of April, near Moncalvo,
with the Governor of Casale; that he told
him he must return once again to Mantua, or to
Venice, because he had written him word that he
would come to him on Ascension-day; that the
aforesaid Governor was content with the expedients
that he had proposed to him for the purpose of delivering
the place to the King, by means of which
his honour appeared to him to be saved; that for
this purpose, at the return of the Sieur de Lestang,
it was necessary there should be an interview be<a class="page" name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a>tween
him, the Sieur de Lestang, the Governor,
and some man on the part of the King, to execute
this affair, and to agree upon means that should
make it infallible; that he would deliver up the
gate of the Citadel which goes into the country,
to which Panissa, who is the Governor of it, would
offer no opposition; that the Count Vialardo,
Governor of the Castle, is entirely devoted to the
Spaniards; that the Governor of Casale requests
that this affair may be quickly concluded, fearing
always lest he should be removed; that he
(Lestang) will make known to the aforesaid Governor
what he shall have done, when he is with
the Duke of Mantua, through the Father Viveti, a
Jacobin living at Padua; that he will continue
to write to all the Courts that the affair of Casale
has failed, and that it will not be completed.</p>

<p>11. A small piece of paper, about as large as a
card, upon which he has written four or five reasons,
to be inserted in the manifesto, when the
troops of the King shall be introduced into Casale.
Also a statement that all that has been done has
been in virtue of the Duke&#8217;s orders, grounded
upon a treaty, signed and ratified by him; but
that he (the Duke) now wished to make another<a class="page" name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a>
with the Spaniards, contrary to the promise he
had given, and that he has even received money
to that effect.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="footnote-anchor">278</a></p>

CATINAT TO LOUVOIS.</h3>

<p class="abstract">First Examination of Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, May 10th, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep"><span class="smcap">I have</span> delivered to the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, by the
hands of his relation, the Abbé de Montesquiou,
all the letters and papers of the Sieur de Lestang,
which consisted in many letters, of which I have
kept a list, containing shortly the subject of each
letter. These letters only show his journeys backwards
and forwards; there are some of them in
which he is advised to take care of himself; one,
among others, is from the Ministers of Mantua,
informing him of the joy of the Duke at his prosperous
return from France, and of his having sent<a class="page" name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a>
a boat to Placentia for him, in order that he may
come to him more securely and more conveniently.
He had many other papers, among which I have
seen nothing of consequence, except a Spanish cypher,
which he confesses to have come from the
Count de Melgar.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="footnote-anchor">279</a></p>

<p>I made him relate before me to the Abbé de
Montesquiou, all that he had done since his return
from France, without interrupting him; having,
nevertheless, let him know, before I permitted him
to speak, that we were perfectly well-informed of
his villainy, in order to see what colour he would
give to his bad conduct. He says, that on his return
from France, he went to Turin, where, from
gratitude to that court, which had done him the
honour of making use of him in many affairs, he
thought himself obliged, on account of civility, to
see the President Turki;<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="footnote-anchor">280</a> that it was true, in talking
of news and of the state of affairs at present,
he allowed him to discover that something new was
about to take place in Italy; and that the afore<a class="page" name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a>said
President, in the course of the conversation
he had with him, gave him to understand that he
had no doubt there had been a treaty made respecting
Casale. It is thus that the Sieur de Lestang
relates what he did at Turin, in order to excuse
his treachery there, of which you, Sir, are already
perfectly well-informed, as well as of the money he
received for it. This was the first discovery that
had been made of this affair, which hitherto had
been conducted so secretly.</p>

<p>From Turin he went, by Placentia, to Mantua,
to join his master, whom he found still well-intentioned
for the completion of the affair. Even two
days after his return, having fallen ill, the Duke of
Mantua came to see him; and he took this occasion
to make him sign the ratification, and to write
a letter to the Governor of Casale, in which he recommended
him to do all that should be told him
by the Sieur de Lestang. Another letter, in form
of a command, was written to the aforesaid Governor,
to receive the troops of the King; in a word,
he was provided at this moment with all things
necessary for the entire conclusion of this affair.
A few days afterwards, he was informed that his
master had changed his resolution; and that it was<a class="page" name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a>
even his intention to take out of his hands all that
he had done and signed, which could render the
treaty valid. That the Duke of Mantua began by
saying that nothing had been done in this business
with his participation; and that he disavowed entirely
all that he, the Sieur de Lestang, had done.
This prince could not then do otherwise, the Spaniards
and his mother being so particularly informed
of this transaction, that they showed him exact
copies of the whole treaty. (These they had acquired,
either by a second piece of treachery of the Sieur
de Lestang, or through the court of Savoy.) The
Sieur de Lestang says, that, under divers pretexts,
he always eluded giving up the originals to the Duke
of Mantua, in order that he might himself remain
master of the affair; and that he had not despaired
of being able to complete it, by contriving expedients
to enable him to surmount the obstacles
that had occurred; as well as through the intelligence
that existed between him and the Governor
of Casale.</p>

<p>He says, that the Spaniards, knowing he was
master of these papers, had made him considerable
offers in order to obtain them. That the Spaniards
being so well-informed, he thought it neces<a class="page" name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a>sary
to make a false confidence to them on the
subject, in order to amuse them, by telling them
that the affair had entirely failed; hoping by this
confidence, to diminish their suspicions, and the
precautions they might have taken to prevent his
profiting by the advantages which his intelligence
with the Governor of Casale gave him for the conclusion
of the business. That he even took this cypher,
of which I have before spoken, from M. de Melgar,
in order to make this false confidence the more
credible to him. Thus it is that this rascal pretends
to escape the accusation that has been made
against him on account of the Spanish cypher,
which has been found in his possession.</p>

<p>He has told us positively, that the Duke of Mantua
was poisoned at the house of an individual
named Le Romain, at Venice, where he went to
drink iced water; that the deed was done by the
Spaniards, and the poison administered by one
of his own domestics; that this prince could not
live more than three or four months. He says
that he learnt this from the Spaniards, with whom
he kept up a communication, for the purpose of
amusing them.</p>

<p>In the midst of these events, he says that he
agreed upon the rendezvous of Incréa, where he<a class="page" name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a>
was to meet d&#8217;Asfeld, on the 7th March, for the
exchange of the ratifications; after which he did
not doubt but he should be able to conclude the
affair, having all the orders necessary, besides his
intelligence with the Governor, so that he could
not have found any obstacle, nor any difficulty;
that in going to the before-mentioned Incréa, he
had been searched and robbed, on the frontiers of
the Brescian and the Milanese; that, notwithstanding,
having remained master of his papers, which
were concealed in a saddle, he had afterwards continued
his journey as far as Buffacore, where the
arrest of d&#8217;Asfeld was confirmed to him in a manner
he could no longer doubt; that M. de Villars,
who was still Ambassador at Turin, having no
knowledge of this affair, and being doubtful himself,
whether, if he came to Pignerol, I<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="footnote-anchor">281</a> should place
confidence in him, he took the resolution of going
back to Venice, to inform M. de Pinchesne of all
that had happened, and to concert new measures
with him; that upon a simple letter of the Abbé
d&#8217;Estrades, who sent him word it was necessary
they should have an interview, he had not lost a
moment of time in going to Turin; that with the<a class="page" name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a>
consent of the aforesaid Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, he had
been at Asti, for the purpose of managing a secret
interview with the Governor of Casale, at a mile
from Moncalvo, in order, by promising him great
recompenses, to engage him to receive the troops,
when, for the saving of his honour, he should have
received an order from his master, and been shown
that he had made a treaty with the King. He says
that he left him in a very good disposition. That
afterwards he returned to Turin, where the Abbé
d&#8217;Estrades proposed to him an interview with me,
in which I arrested him.</p>

<p>This, Sir, is the simple and true recital of what
the Sieur de Lestang has told me, which confirms
me in the belief that he is a thorough rascal; not
having been able to give me any good reason why
he discovered this affair to the President Turki,
when he passed through Turin; or why he concealed
from M. de Pinchesne his communication
with the Spaniards, his acceptation of their cypher,
and his interviews with an Inquisitor of State at
Venice; if, as he says, he only did these things in
order the better to advance the affair in question.</p>

<p>I have made him write three letters for the purpose
of getting possession of the original papers<a class="page" name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a>
which are at Padua, which have been put into the
hands of the Sieur Giuliani, by the advice of the
Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, who places an entire confidence
in him: he will make use of these three letters as
he shall judge most fit, according to the disposition
in which he shall find the father of the Sieur
de Lestang. The first is only a letter of the Sieur
de Lestang to his father, in which he acquaints
him, that there are reasons which oblige him to
remain at Turin, or in the neighbourhood, but
that he may place an entire confidence in the Sieur
Giuliani, and deliver to him such and such papers,
of which I have made him give the inventory to
the Sieur Giuliani. The second acquaints his father
with the real state in which he is, and that it
is important, as well for his life as his honour, that
his papers should be immediately delivered into
the hands of the Sieur Giuliani. In the third, which
is the last to be made use of, in case the two first
have no effect, he desires him to come to Turin; and
tells him that at the house of the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades
he will be instructed where he is, and the means to
be employed to speak with him. The Sieur de Lestang
has no doubt of being able, in this interview
between him and his father, to persuade him to all<a class="page" name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a>
he may wish. I have inspired him with so great
a fear of the punishments due to his bad conduct,
that I find no repugnance in him to do all that I
require of him, and he appears sincere in the wish
of obtaining the delivery of the papers, which will
be sent to M. de Pinchesne at Venice, in order to
avoid any accidents that might happen to them in
so long a journey as that from Padua to this place,
or to Turin.</p>

<p>I place no confidence in what this rascal tells
me; nevertheless I think it right to inform you,
Sir, that he declares positively that the Governor
of Casale is his friend, and that, by promising him
a considerable recompense, and by furnishing him
with a pretext to save his honour, which may be
done by giving him the order of his master, (which
the Sieur de Lestang says is at Padua,) to receive
the King&#8217;s troops, we can make him do whatever
we wish. That he can deliver up the town, and
that the Governor of the citadel is his intimate
friend, whom he can persuade to do whatever he
shall order him. As for the castle, which I saw
when I was passing through Casale, it is rather a
sort of little citadel than a simple castle. The
Sieur de Lestang says, that assuredly the governor<a class="page" name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a>
of it will not submit himself to the orders of the
Governor of Casale, although the latter has the
command over him, because the aforesaid governor,
whose name is Vialardo, is entirely devoted to the
Spaniards; that this is a thing which he has heard
from the Spaniards themselves, and that on the
least change at Casale, or the march of troops towards
it, the Governors of Valenza, Novara, and
Pavia, have orders to send detachments of their
garrisons to the aforesaid Casale, and that they
will be infallibly let into the place through the
castle. This Vialardo is brother of a secretary of
the Duke of Mantua, who bears the same name,
and who is also entirely in the Spanish faction.</p>

<p>However, when we shall have obtained possession
of the papers, it is not impossible but we may
be able to contrive something with the Governor
of Casale, if he is in those sentiments that the
Sieur de Lestang ascribes to him, and if he is the
master to receive troops in the town and citadel.
This affair, if conducted very secretly, and with
the rapid march of a regiment or two of dragoons,
might take the Spaniards so much by surprise,
that they might not have any sufficient means in
their power to be able to counteract it. If we<a class="page" name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a>
were masters of the town and citadel, and had as
large a number of troops as that which was destined
to the execution of this affair, I am certain
that the castle could not prevent any resolutions
that we might wish to take. We might receive
upon this subject important intelligence from an
interview with the Governor of Casale. The
difficulty is how to contrive it so as to discover
his intentions, without the negociations passing
through the hands of our rascal, in whom we cannot
place any reliance. But, when we have the
papers, if this affair was despaired of as far as
regards the Duke of Mantua, and that the King
thought that the plan I send to you, Sir, was
worth trying, I would concert what was to be
done with the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, according to the
orders I should receive upon the subject. I beg
pardon, Sir, for troubling you with so long a
letter; but I could not acquaint you in fewer
words with the conduct of the Sieur de Lestang,
and with what has passed between him and me.</p>

<p class="abstract">Interviews between the Duke of Mantua and the Senator Foscarini.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, May 13th, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I beseech</span> you very humbly to be persuaded
that I will not fail to execute, with all the exactitude
and zeal possible, the orders which it has
pleased you to give me, (in the letter which you have
done me the honour to write to me on the 26th of
last month,) to inform you of all that shall come to
my knowledge respecting the affair of Casale, and
on the subject of the Count Matthioli. The annoyance
I had, at not being able to discover what
brought the Duke of Mantua to Venice, the last
time when, as I sent you word, he came there, obliged
me to redouble my endeavours to try and
learn something upon the subject; and at last
they have not been in vain, since I know at present,
so certainly that I cannot doubt of it, that
this prince had, during that time, two long conversations,
in the Convent of the Capuchins, with
M. Foscarini, a sage and a grandee, who is the
person named by the Republic, to continue the<a class="page" name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a>
history which the Procurator Nani was about, and
who is one of the most able men of this state: in
which this senator represented to him very strongly
how dangerous it would be for him and for all
Italy if he gave up Casale to the King, as it was
said he had the intention to do, and had even
made a treaty for that purpose with His Majesty,
and that the Republic hoped he would not take a
step so prejudicial to all the princes of Italy; to
which I know that the Duke of Mantua answered,
that he knew his own interests, and that assuredly
he would never voluntarily give up Casale to the
King; but that His Majesty was the most powerful
Prince in Europe, and in a condition to attempt
every thing, without its being easy to prevent
him; that it would be therefore necessary to seek
for the most proper means to do this, which, however,
could not be hoped for, without having considerable
troops to oppose to his, in case he wished
to attempt some enterprise; that of himself he
was not sufficiently powerful to resist His Majesty;
that it was for those, who had as much interest
as himself in the preservation of that place, to
find the means of preserving it, without which he
would not answer for what might happen; and that<a class="page" name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a>
the fault even could not be attributed to him, but
to his bad fortune and to his want of aid.</p>

<p>I know, besides, that the ministers of the Republic
consider it certain that Casale is to be attacked
by the King, and that they say they have
this intelligence from such good authority, that
they cannot doubt of it.</p>

that you will have sufficiently seen by my former
letters, that it is not the intention of the King

this, until you shall have given him the answers
he is to bring back.</p>

CATINAT TO LOUVOIS.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Plans of Catinat for obtaining possession of Casale.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, May 16th, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep">I send you, Sir, the second examination of M.
Matthioli, according to the order which I received
to that effect, by the extraordinary courier you
sent to this place. You will find it little different
from the first. I put him into the greatest
possible fear of the torture, if he did not tell
the truth. One sees very well by his answers that
his conduct has been infamous. I see no good
reason which can excuse him for having had such
intimate communication with the Court of Savoy,
with the Abbé Frederic (the resident of the Emperor
at Venice), and with Don Francis Visconti,
one of the partizans of Spain, without any participation
or correspondence upon the subject with
M. de Pomponne, the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, or M.
de Pinchesne; this fact prevents my having any
confidence in him. Nevertheless he persists, with
the utmost obstinacy, in declaring, that the Go<a class="page" name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a>vernor
of Casale is well-intentioned; that this Governor
sees very well that the Duke of Mantua is
a lost man; that he sees also that there cannot
happen any change in the Court of Mantua, without
his being removed from Casale; and that he
is a man who would be accessible to any offers
that might be made him; this is what he, Matthioli,
is willing to stake his life upon; that if he
is furnished with a specious excuse for receiving
the troops of the King, he will assuredly do it,
which will be easy, when we have the original papers
which his father is to deliver into the hands
of Giuliani; that provided the Governor is not
absent from Casale, he, Matthioli, will find means
to contrive an interview between this Governor,
me, and himself; and that I shall both see and
understand the means of rendering the King master
of Casale. As I know beforehand that I am
conversing with a rascal, and that it is almost of
necessity, if his propositions are adopted, that he
should himself be again employed in this affair,
I cannot bring myself to answer for him in any
thing; nevertheless I have thought it right to
communicate all this, Sir, to you. When the
King once has possession of the papers, my hav<a class="page" name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a>ing
an interview with this Governor is a step that
would not hazard any thing; I do not see any inconvenience
in it, except the chance of the Sieur
Matthioli&#8217;s escaping, on account of the degree of
liberty which must in that case be permitted to
him, however vigilant I might be in watching him.
I should be obliged to go with him to Asti, where
he is acquainted with a Dominican monk, who
would carry to Moncalvo a note to a physician
whose name is Viveti; this Viveti would go to
Casale to inform the Governor of the place of rendezvous,
which had been settled for our interview
with him. But it is almost impossible in all these
proceedings to answer for the person of Matthioli:
as there is, therefore, this inconvenience in
the plan, the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades could, if it is the
King&#8217;s wish that any proposition should be made
to this Governor, according to the orders he
should receive, have him spoken to, and his intentions
sounded by some one. I beseech you,
Sir, to be persuaded that in this affair I place
my own interest beneath my feet, and that I only
venture to make you proposals upon the subject,
from the desire I have that the affair should succeed
to the satisfaction of the King.</p>

<p>As the papers which are at Padua are to be
sent, at least I believe so, to M. de Pinchesne, in
order to avoid any accidents that might happen to
them by bringing them straight to this place or to
Turin, I will take measures to set off from hence
as soon as I shall know they are delivered to M.
de Pinchesne. As you, Sir, may perhaps wish to
send me word of any new determinations that may
have been come to with regard to this affair, in
consequence of which I might be of some utility
here, I take the liberty of informing you, that I
shall remain at Pignerol till the 9th or 10th of
June. If you do not honour me with any order
between this time and then, I shall execute that
you have already given me of returning to France.
I should be obliged to you to let me know where
I am to go, whether straight to the Court, or to
Dunkirk, where my company is, or to any other
place where it shall please you to order me. I
shall take great precautions to conceal myself, and
not to appear before the relations of Messrs. Fouquet
and Lauzun.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="footnote-anchor">287</a> I cannot, however, answer<a class="page" name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a>
for it, Sir, that they will not write word of my
being here. I did not take any measures for the
Ambassador being present at this last examination,
because I had been before particularly informed
by him of all the proofs there were against
Matthioli.</p>

<h3><a name="appendix_92" id="appendix_92"></a>No. 92.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Second Examination of Matthioli.</p>

<p>The Count Matthioli being asked what happened
to him when he passed through Turin, replied,
that he had been to visit the Marquis of
Saint-Thomas; that as he was ill, he could not see
him; that afterwards he went to the President
Turki, whom he found full of suspicions respecting
his journey into France; and that as he is an
insinuating and adroit man, he engaged him insensibly
to talk of the affairs of the Duke of Mantua
and of Casale; that it is true, that being taken
by surprise by the ingenuity and cunning of the<a class="page" name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a>
aforesaid President, and by the affection which he
pretended to show for the interests of France, he
confided so much in the aforesaid President, that
it was impossible for him to doubt but that there
was some treaty made respecting Casale; that it is
true, that he received two thousand livres from
that Court,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="footnote-anchor">289</a> but that it was rather as a mark of
gratitude for some services he had formerly had
the honour of performing for it, than as a recompense
for any thing he then confided.</p>

<p>He says that the President Turki begged him,
when he left Turin, to write to him carefully all
the progress of this affair; that he, the President,
had written to him several times after this to
Venice, asking for intelligence upon the subject;
to which he had always answered that the affair
would not take place, in order to diminish the
opinion he might have had, from his former answers
to him, of there being a treaty respecting
that place.</p>

<p>Being asked where he went from Turin, he replied,
that he took the road to Placentia, where
he found letters from Don Nevani and Cabriani,<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="footnote-anchor">290</a><a class="page" name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a>
which were only to testify their joy at his return,
and to tell him that the Duke of Mantua waited
for him with impatience, and that they had sent a
boat to meet him, in order that he might be able
to embark upon the Po.</p>

<p>From Placentia he went straight to Mantua,
where he found the Duke of Mantua; who, the
very day of his arrival, took the trouble of coming
to see him at his own house, where he was lying
down, being very ill; this interview was passed in
civilities respecting his malady. Two days afterwards
he came again to see him, and asked him
for a copy of all that he had done in France,
which he gave him very exactly, but with great
pain to himself, on account of his illness. That
same day he made the Duke sign all the papers
necessary for the entire completion of the treaty,
as far as regarded the form. Three or four days
afterwards, having received intelligence from the
Sieur Carbonini, that there was a plan to poison
him, and having even perceived that they had put
poison into a medicine, which he had pretended
to take, but had found the means of throwing
away, he had taken the resolution, under the pretext
of recovering his health, of going to Padua,<a class="page" name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a>
whither he had taken all the original papers with
him.</p>

<p>On the 24th or 25th of January, the Duke of
Mantua, in his way to Venice, passed through Padua;
where he went to see the Sieur Matthioli,
who was ill, and where he told the Sieur Matthioli,
that he had not been able to avoid talking
of this affair to his Mother, and that it was an
affair which means must be found to break off, because
it was not for his advantage. To which, the
aforesaid Matthioli answered several things, and
among others, that he had again written quite lately
to the court to say that all was signed; and that
these were the sort of engagements that it was not
easy to get released from. The Duke of Mantua
afterwards asked him for the original papers, to
which he replied that they were locked up, and
that it would be a great inconvenience to him,
being as ill as he was, to go and look for them;
but that he would come as soon as he was able to
Venice, where he would deliver the whole into his
hands.</p>

<p>He says that the Sieur Giuliani came to see him
at Padua from the Duke of Mantua, to give him
intelligence that the Inquisitors of State at Venice<a class="page" name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a>
were making search for him, and that he must
take his measures accordingly, in order not to be
seized with the papers; which obliged him to mix
them with many others, and to place them in a
separate house from the one he lived in.</p>

<p>After having been three weeks at Padua, he set
off for Venice, leaving the original papers, and not
taking them with him. He arrived ill at Venice;
went to bed as soon as he arrived there, where he
remained three days; afterwards he went to see
the Duke of Mantua, who told him that the Abbé
Frederic, the Resident of the Emperor at Venice,
was acquainted with all the affair respecting Casale;
to which the aforesaid Matthioli answered
that he was not surprised at it, and that assuredly
his Mother, to whom he had told all himself, had
had no reserve upon the subject with the aforesaid
Abbé Frederic. He asked him afterwards for the
original papers, which he told him he could not
give him, having left them at Padua, upon the advice
which Giuliani had given him from him, to
take care that the Venetians, who were looking out
for him, should not find them in his possession.
The Duke of Mantua told him that it was absolutely
necessary to break off this affair; to which<a class="page" name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a>
he answered that he ought to take care how he
behaved with regard to the King; that he had entered
into engagements from which he could not
extricate himself without breaking his word, which
would be very dangerous to do with so powerful a
Prince. The Duke of Mantua obliged him afterwards
to have an interview with him and the Abbé
Frederic, which took place in the chamber of a
Monk of Saint George; they were masked there,
in order not to be known. The Duke of Mantua
said to the Sieur Matthioli, &#8220;I leave you with the
Abbé Frederic, with whom you will hold a conversation;
you must do all that he shall bid you.&#8221;
The aforesaid Abbé Frederic showed him a copy
of the treaty; and appeared so particularly instructed
upon the subject, that there was no
possibility of his denying it. The aforesaid Abbé
told him that it was an affair which must be
broken off; that it would be the ruin of Italy
and of his master also, and that it was absolutely
necessary to think of some means which
would make it certain not to happen; and that
he might expect a great deal of gratitude from
the House of Austria, if he conducted himself well.
He confesses that he appeared to enter into his
sentiments, not being able to do otherwise; but<a class="page" name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a>
that remaining master of the original papers, he
thought he should be always able to complete the
affair, which he intended to do in this manner.</p>

<p>The Governor of Casale being his friend, he did
not doubt but that he should be able to make him
do all that he wished. To this end, he made a
packet of the four blank papers signed by the
Duke of Mantua, which he had made him sign at
Mantua when he first arrived there, and while this
Prince was still well-intentioned. That in order to
inspire more confidence to the Governor of Casale,
that he, the Sieur Matthioli, would do nothing,
except with the order of his master, he had had
this packet addressed to him by another Secretary
of the Duke of Mantua, named Magnus, who has
for his department the management of the affairs
of the Montferrat, to whom he said, &#8220;Here is a
packet which his Highness has told me to send
to Casale: as you administer the affairs of that
country, write a letter to the Governor, ordering
him to execute all that is to be enjoined by this
packet.&#8221; That this proceeding procured for him
the entire confidence of the Governor, by making
him see that he would not ask any thing of him
which he could not execute with honour; that he<a class="page" name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a>
had made d&#8217;Asfeld set off from Venice two or
three days afterwards, in order to arrive about
the same time with him at Incréa, where he intended
to have taken all the necessary measures
with the aforesaid Governor, for the completion of
the affair.</p>

<p>Being asked why he had acted in this indirect
manner, (since it had been agreed in the interview
which he, M. de Pinchesne, and M. d&#8217;Asfeld had
had together on the 24th of February, that the
Duke of Mantua should go to Casale on the 15th
of March, which was a decided mark of the good
intentions of his Master), he replied, that his Master
was truly well-intentioned, from the fear he had
inspired him with of the King&#8217;s resentment; but that
knowing the natural uncertainty of his disposition,
he had thought it right to take measures to enable
him to complete the affair, even in case he (the Duke)
had not kept to his engagement of coming to Casale.
Being asked why he did not confide this to
the Sieurs de Pinchesne and d&#8217;Asfeld, he said that
he did not wish to discover to them the intelligence
that existed between him and the Governor, or to
give them any idea of uncertainty in this affair,
which might perhaps have made them suspend the<a class="page" name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a>
execution of it; that as he himself regarded it as
the means of making his fortune, if he could bring
it to a conclusion, and as he did not doubt that
such would be the event, from the measures he had
taken, he wished to avoid all that might retard the
execution of it. That the Sieur de Pinchesne can
say whether he, the Sieur Matthioli, did not always
answer to him for the success of the affair, without,
however, being ever willing to communicate to
him the means to be employed in it.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he did not speak of the
affair of Casale with certain Venetians, he answered
that they were so well-informed upon the subject,
that it is very likely he may have conversed with
some of them upon it, but in the way of telling
them that it was an affair which was broken off,
and had failed; that he had seen the Chevalier Cornaro,
Inquisitor of State, only once, for the purpose
of asking his permission to carry arms, as the
Duke of Mantua wished to have him assassinated,
in order the better to authorize his disavowal of
all that he, the Sieur Matthioli, had done in France,
which was certainly a very unjust reason on the
part of his Master for wishing to have him killed;
that as he was of a fickle disposition, his senti<a class="page" name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a>ments
would change upon this subject as upon
every thing else; and that by making use of precautions
for some time, he should escape this misfortune:
this permission was promised, but was
never given to him.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had not conversed at
Venice with some one of the partisans of Spain, he
answered, no; that he left that place on the 28th
of February, two days after M. d&#8217;Asfeld, to go to
Incréa.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had not known beforehand,
that the Sieur d&#8217;Asfeld was to be arrested,
he answered that he had had no knowledge of it,
and that he had even only known with certainty
his detention at Buffacore, as far as which place he
had gone on his road to the rendezvous at Incréa,
having with him all the papers necessary for the
conclusion of the affair of Casale, which he had
concealed so well in a saddle, that they were not
found, though he was very minutely searched
upon the frontiers of the Brescian and the Milanese;
that from Buffacore he returned straight
to Venice, not having any doubt of the arrest of
d&#8217;Asfeld, from the news he had received respecting
it; that he only remained there two days, in<a class="page" name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a>
order to inform M. de Pinchesne of the accidents
that had happened.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he conversed with other
persons at Venice, he answered, no.</p>

<p>When he left Venice he returned to Padua,
where he remained always, except some short visits
to Venice, of a day at the longest, to confer with
M. de Pinchesne.</p>

<p>Being asked if, at Padua, he had not held intercourse
with some one of the partisans of Spain; he
answered, yes; with the individual named Don
Francis Visconti, natural son of the Count Visconti,
Commissary-General of the Milanese, who had
spoken to him on the part of his father and of
the Count de Melgar, and who having in his possession
a copy of the treaty, and being perfectly
instructed of the whole transaction, it was not
possible for him to deny it; but he spoke of it
as an affair that had failed, and gained the confidence
of the aforesaid Francis, who offered him
a thousand pistoles, and a fief in the Milanese,
if he would deliver to M. de Melgar the original
papers which were in his possession. He answered
him that this affair having appeared to him to
have failed, he had given them to M. de Pin<a class="page" name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a>chesne,
and was no longer master of them. The
aforesaid Francis persuaded him to enter into communication
with M. de Melgar, in order, for the
future, to prevent the execution of this affair, and
took measures with him, about the 10th or 12th
of March, for acquainting M. de Melgar with
every thing; and to this end agreed with him
upon the Spanish cypher found among his papers.
He says that he did all this only to deceive them,
and to prevent their taking other means, than
through him, of being informed of the resolutions
of the King in this affair.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he did not know, through
the means of Francis, of the arrest of d&#8217;Asfeld,
he answered, yes, and that the aforesaid Francis
told him he had been arrested at Canonica, twenty-five
miles from Milan, on the side of Bergamo,
and that they had been waiting for him there
more than a fortnight.</p>

<p>Being asked if he knew who were the people
that arrested him, he answered, that he did not
know precisely, but that Don Francis had told
him they were people employed by M. de Melgar,
and that they had been placed upon various routes
in order not to miss him. Don Francis told him<a class="page" name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a>
besides that he was a prisoner in the castle of
Milan; that he was very civilly treated there;
and that he had not been interrogated, nor found
charged with any papers.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had not given any body
a copy of the treaty; he swore distinctly that he
had given it to no one, and that those copies which
have got about could only have come from the
mother of the Duke of Mantua, to whom her son
had confided the whole affair.</p>

<p>He came from Padua to Turin, upon receiving
the letter of the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, in order to contrive
an interview with the Governor of Casale;
which he had done, and had found the Governor
well inclined to contribute to the completion of
the business. From thence he returned to Turin,
where the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades persuaded him to have
an interview with me, during which I arrested
him. I send this last fact to you, Sir, shortly,
because I have already given you a sufficiently
exact detail respecting it.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="footnote-anchor">291</a></p>

<p class="abstract">Further particulars respecting Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, May 21st, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep">I only send you, Sir, the answers which the
Sieur Lestang has made to me upon the points, on<a class="page" name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a>
which you have ordered me to interrogate him; the
preceding examinations, which I took the liberty
of sending you, having already informed you upon
other subjects, and generally upon every thing
which I have been able to learn from the aforesaid
Sieur de Lestang. He is a man whose conduct
has been so infamous, that one cannot answer for
the truth of any thing he says; nevertheless, I
believe him to be sincere in the desire he shows
that the original papers should be in the King&#8217;s
possession. He sees very well, that he has only
this way of getting out of the affair. I have already,
Sir, made you acquainted with the means
we are making use of to obtain them. I am also
persuaded that he has had intimate communications
with the Governor of Casale; perhaps,
though, the detention of the Sieur de Lestang may
have changed the dispositions of the latter. The
Sieur de Lestang has told me, that at their last
interview near Moncalvo, the aforesaid Governor
pressed him to conclude this affair, saying, that
any delay in the execution of it was dangerous;
that the four black papers signed, which he had
sent him, were sufficient, if they were filled up with
what was necessary, so that he might appear to act<a class="page" name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a>
according to orders; that it was also necessary to
let him have an interview with some confidential
man on the part of the King, with whom he might
agree upon every thing; he told him even that
the civilities he had shown me when I was at
Casale, were only because he thought I was a
man employed in this affair, although I called
myself an officer going to Vercelli, and that for the
chance of this, he was determined to treat me with
great distinction. Lestang has told me that he
related all this to the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades. I have
asked him why, as the Governor was so well-intentioned,
he, Lestang, had eluded a prompt execution,
when it was proposed to him? He answers
to this, that he had engaged himself by letter to
the Duke of Mantua to be at Venice on Ascension-day,
where he still hoped to have sufficient influence
over him to extract from him a last consent.
That he should immediately after this have
brought back the original papers, and that having
already taken his measures with the Governors of
the town and of the citadel, the execution of the
affair would not have had to encounter any further
difficulty; that Vialardo, Governor of the castle,
being of the Spanish faction, might have been a<a class="page" name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a>
small obstacle, but not to signify, when the town
and the citadel should have been in our possession.
I send you, Sir, all that this man has told me, without
being answerable for the truth of it. I shall
set off the 2d of next month, as I have already
done myself the honour of acquainting you, Sir, if
between this time and then, I hear that the papers
have been delivered to M. de Pinchesne.</p>

<h3><a name="appendix_95" id="appendix_95"></a>No. 95.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Third Examination of Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">May 21st, 1679.</p>

<p class="date-sep">Being asked whether at his return from France
he had not seen the president Turki; he answered,
that it is true he had told him there was a
treaty respecting Casale, and that he had even
told him the conditions of it, but that he could
not have given him an exact copy of it, because
he had not his papers with him, having<a class="page" name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a>
sent them from Lyons to Placentia, addressed to
one of his friends named M. Rigueti-Cannevavi,
Chancellor-general of the posts, in order to avoid
having them with him in his journey through
Italy.</p>

<p>Being asked why he made this confidence to
the President Turki; he answered, that he had
known the President for four or five years; and
that in the course of conversation, from indiscretion
and quick talking, he had allowed himself to
tell too much.</p>

<p>Being asked what the aforesaid President said
to him, when he had told him that there was a
treaty respecting Casale; he answered, that M.
Turki explained to him that it would disturb
the whole of Italy, and that it would cause a war
there; that the aforesaid President gave him several
good reasons for this.</p>

<p>Being asked why he, who had the honour of
being the head of so great and important a negociation,
had commenced it with the intention of
preventing the execution of it, as he had said at
Turin; he answered, that this was never his design;
that it was very true that he had said to
the President Turki, that there was no appear<a class="page" name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a>ance
of this treaty being executed, because it depended
upon the peace, and that if the war was
at an end, he was persuaded they should never
manage to arrive at the execution of it. The
aforesaid President upon this told him, that peace
would certainly be made; but that, if under any
circumstances a change was to take place at
Casale, he would rather prefer that the French
should be the masters of it than the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Being asked why he wrote so regularly from
Venice and from Padua, upon the subject of this
affair, to the aforesaid President; he answered,
that the aforesaid President begged him, when he
left Turin, to do so, and to acquaint him exactly
with all that should be done in relation to this affair;
that in pursuance of the promise he had made him
to that effect, he had always sent him accounts of
it, but written in the sense as if it would not take
place, the peace being at present concluded, and
the affair of Guastalla being settled, which was
one of the most powerful motives that had urged
the Duke of Mantua to put himself under the
protection of the King. That he persuaded the
aforesaid President that this affair would not take
place, in order that the intelligence he gave him<a class="page" name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a>
might agree with what he told the Duke of Mantua
himself, and the Abbé Frederic, resident of
the Emperor at Venice; and that he encouraged
this opinion in the mind of every body, the better
to arrive at his ends, and to succeed in the plan he
had of introducing the troops of the King into
Casale, through the means of his intelligence with
the Governor. That this intention never quitted
him for a moment, and that what now was considered
as his crime, would appear a most able contrivance,
if the whole of this affair was ever thoroughly
known. That his obstinacy in keeping
possession of the original papers, and his understanding
with the Governor of Casale, are proofs
of the truth of this; that if he had not had a
well-grounded intention of serving the King, he
should not have taken such care of these papers,
the retaining of which brought upon him the indignation
of his master, and even put his life into
great jeopardy; and that his secret intelligence
with the Governor was perfectly useless to him,
unless his intentions were true and faithful.</p>

<p>Being asked what were the contents of the letters
he received from the President; he answered,
that he had received one among others, in which<a class="page" name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a>
the aforesaid President wrote him word that he
was sure he was deceiving him, by always telling
him that the affair of Casale would not take place;
because of the arrival of troops in the quarters
behind Pignerol, which could only be for the
affair of Casale.</p>

<p>Being asked whether the President Turki had
not shown to him a desire that this affair should
fail; he answered, no; that he had always conversed
upon it without delivering an opinion, at the
same time showing a great deal of curiosity to be
informed exactly of all that might happen relating
to this affair.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had seen the Marquis
of Saint-Maurice: he answered, no.</p>

<p>Being asked, through whom the Court of Savoy
could have received such particular information;
he answered, that it must have been through the
Count of Juvenasque, the Resident from Spain at
that Court, who has a great deal of intercourse
with the Monk Bulgarini; and that the aforesaid
Bulgarini had known every thing from the mother
of the Duke of Mantua.</p>

<p>Being asked why he had acquainted the Count
Hercules Visconti of the departure from Venice<a class="page" name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a>
of the Sieur d&#8217;Asfeld; he answered, that he had
had no intercourse with him, till his return from
Buffacore to Padua, after the arrest of the Sieur
d&#8217;Asfeld, when Don Francis, the natural son of
the Count Hercules Visconti, saw him, and held
intercourse with him; which he had confessed to in
his first examinations.</p>

<p>Being asked whether the original papers were
at Padua, he answered affirmatively, yes; and that
it is his real intention they should be delivered
up to the King, as he sees this is the only means
of atoning for his conduct.</p>

<p>Being asked whether on his arrival at Turin, he
had not asked the President Turki to be allowed
to speak to <i>Madame Royale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="footnote-anchor">295</a> as he had affairs of
great consequence to communicate to her; he answered,
no; and that he had neither desired, nor
asked to speak to any one, except the aforesaid
President.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had not written to
<i>Madame Royale</i> from Padua, to request that she
would send him a man to whom he could confide
the real state of things, he answered readily, no;<a class="page" name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a>
but that he would tell it as freely, if it had been
the case, as he had avowed that he had always held
communication upon the subject of this affair with
the President Turki, from his wish to deceive him,
by sending him word that it would not succeed.</p>

<p>His answers elude, but do not deny all that has
been said of him. In order to account for the communications
he has held, he makes use of the continual
pretext, that he was obliged to hold them,
in order to deceive, and to obtain the success of
the affair by taking the other side by surprise;
making use, as the means of this surprise, of his
intelligences with the Governor.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="footnote-anchor">294</a></p>

CATINAT TO LOUVOIS.</h3>

<p class="abstract">Concluding examination of Matthioli.</p>

<p class="date">Pignerol, June 3d, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The original papers have been delivered to
Giuliani, who has taken them to Venice to M. de
Pinchesne: they consist of the treaty which the
aforesaid Lestang had made with the Court, which
is signed by him and by M. de Pomponne: an
instruction which was given to the aforesaid Les<a class="page" name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a>tang,
when he left the Court: the full power given
to M. de Pomponne to treat with him, which is
signed by you: and a letter from his Majesty to
the Duke of Mantua. All these papers were in a
box which had been placed in the Convent of Capuchins.
Giuliani performed his duty very well,
and so completely persuaded the father of the
aforesaid Lestang, that the papers were delivered
into his hands with all confidence. The ratification
of the Duke of Mantua is not to be found,
although the Sieur de Lestang said it was amongst
them: whereupon I interrogated him; having first
obtained all the advantage over him I could, by
abusing him, and bringing soldiers into his room,
as if preparatory to administering the question
to him, which made him so much afraid, that he
promised really to tell the truth. Being asked
whether the Duke of Mantua had ratified the
treaty; he answered that he had never subscribed
to all the articles, but that he had got from him
four blank papers signed, one of which was a blank
paper of two sheets, at the top of which he had
written: <i>Ratification of the treaty made with his
most Christian Majesty</i>. That there were three
other blank papers signed, of one sheet each, of<a class="page" name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a>
which he intended to make use to write in the
name of his master to the three Governors, of the
town, citadel, and castle, to order them to receive
the King&#8217;s troops. Being asked where these blank
papers signed are at present, he answered, that
they are in the hands of the Governor of Casale,
to whom he sent them at the time that d&#8217;Asfeld
left Venice. Being asked why he had sent them,
without their being filled up, to the Governor of
Casale; he answered, he had sent them to him in
a letter of Magnus, the Secretary of the Duke of
Mantua, in which the Governor was ordered to do
without hesitation, all that should be told him, regarding
the execution of the orders contained in
that packet,&mdash;that they were left blank, because
he wished to make the ratification according to
that of the King, not knowing, as he says, exactly
the form in which it ought to have been made out.
Being asked why in his first examination he had
said that this ratification was at Padua; he answered,
that he had not wished to tell where it was
before Giuliani, in order not to make him acquainted
in any way with his intelligence with the Governor:
he added that he had never had any other
ratification except that one; and that whatever tor<a class="page" name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a>tures
should be inflicted on him, he could never
tell any thing more. He has not told me any
thing new relating to the imprisonment of d&#8217;Asfeld,
and he says that he has no further knowledge
of it than what I have already, Sir, sent word of
to you.</p>

<p>I have taken leave of the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades, as
we were both agreed of my inutility here at present.
I shall, therefore, set off the 6th, to come to the
Court, as you, Sir, have ordered me; where I shall
have the honour of testifying to you my lively gratitude
for the favours, which your protection has
gained for me; and for the kindness with which
you acquainted me with the last you had procured
for me.</p>

<p class="abstract">Proposed recompense to Giuliani.</p>

<p class="date">Venice, July 1, 1679.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>In answer to the letter which you were pleased
to write to me on the 14th of last month, I shall do
myself the honour to tell you that, although I am
aware that Giuliani has performed services which
have been useful to the King, and that I am persuaded
of his fidelity, and of his good inclinations
towards France, which may render him still very
useful for the future, I cannot forbear representing
to you, that the recompense which the Abbé d&#8217;Estrades
wished to procure for him, is not a fitting one;
and I feel myself the more obliged to say this, because
you do me the honour to inform me that his
Majesty wishes to receive further information on
this subject. I shall therefore, Sir, take the liberty
to tell you, that he is a little editor of newspapers,
in whose shop the letters of news are written, as it
is not the custom here to print them: he works<a class="page" name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a>
at this himself, as well as copying for the public;
and his situation in this town answers to that of
the Secretaries of St. Innocent, at Paris. Therefore,
it would be a very improper thing to give a
Secretaryship of Embassy to a man of this profession,
who, besides, in other respects, does not appear
to me fit to fill properly such an employment. He
would even cease to be able to give intelligence, as
soon as he should be publicly recognized to be
attached to France, because the persons whom he
now holds communication with, would no longer
wish, nor dare, to continue it with him. But
as he is a sort of <i>ferret</i>, who works out, and gets
at all that is passing, I think it is necessary to encourage
his zeal by some such gratification as forty
or fifty pistoles a year, or whatever shall be approved
of by his Majesty. I think even that this
sort of recompense would have a greater effect
upon him than the other, and would make him
act with the same zeal he has already shown in
the affairs he has been employed in.</p>

who is almost as mad as the Jacobin,
walked about with long strides, with his cloak
over his nose, crying out that he was not a
dupe, but that he knew more than he would say.
The Jacobin, who was always seated on his truckle
bed, with his elbows resting upon his knees,
looked at him gravely, without listening to him.
The Signor Matthioli remained always persuaded
that it was a spy that had been placed with him,
till he was one day disabused, by the Jacobin&#8217;s
getting down from his bed, stark naked, and setting
himself to preach, without rhyme or reason,<a class="page" name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a>

<p class="date-sep"><span class="smcap">In</span> order to explain to you, Sir, more amply
than I have hitherto done, the story of the diamond
ring which the Sieur Matthioli gave to
Blainvilliers, I shall begin by taking the liberty to
tell you that I believe he made him this present as
much from fear as from any other cause: this prisoner
having previously used very violent language
to him, and written abusive sentences with charcoal
on the wall of his room, which had obliged
that officer to menace him with severe punishment,
if he was not more decorous and moderate in his
language for the future. When he was put in the
tower with the Jacobin, I charged Blainvilliers to
tell him, at the same time showing him a cudgel,
that it was with that the unruly were rendered
manageable, and that if he did not speedily be<a class="page" name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a>come
the latter, he could easily be compelled to it.
This message was conveyed to him, and some days
afterwards, as Blainvilliers was waiting on him at
dinner, he said to him; <i>Sir, here is a little ring
which I wish to give you, and I beg you to accept
of it</i>. Blainvilliers replied to him that <i>he only took
it to deliver it to me, as he could not receive any
thing himself from the prisoners</i>. I think it is well
worth fifty or sixty pistoles.</p>

of the two prisoners in the lower part of the tower,

remainder of the prisoners at present under your
charge, who are to remain in the citadel of Pignerol
should be left to the care of a Captain of a Battalion,
who may be changed from day to day,
I address to you an order from the King to have
the Sieur de Villebois recognized as Commandant
of the aforesaid citadel of Pignerol, until the return
of M. de Rissan, or the arrival of the person
whom His Majesty shall entrust with the command
of the aforesaid citadel. In case the health of
the aforesaid Sieur de Rissan does not permit
him to return there, you will, if you please, acquaint
the aforesaid Sieur de Villebois with it, to<a class="page" name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a>
whom the Sieur du Channoy has orders to pay
two crowns a day, for the support of those three
prisoners.</p>

<p>You will see by the orders of the King hereunto
joined, that your company is to be reduced
to forty-five men, to commence from the 15th of
this month; and by the statement which accompanies
them, the footing upon which it is to be

whom His Majesty expects that you will guard
with the same exactitude you have made use of
hitherto. Therefore, it only remains for me to
recommend you to give me, from time to time,
intelligence respecting them.</p>

<p>With regard to the effects belonging to the
Sieur Matthioli, which are in your possession,
you will have them taken to Exiles, in order to
be given back to him, if ever His Majesty should
order him to be set at liberty.</p>

<p class="abstract">Description of the Apartment and manner of Confinement
of the Prisoners at Exiles.</p>

<p class="date">Exiles, March 11th, 1682.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have received the letter which you were
pleased to do me the honour to write to me on
the 27th of last month, in which you acquaint me,
Sir, that it is important my two prisoners should
have no communication with any one. Since the
first time that you, Sir, gave me this order, I have
guarded these two prisoners, who are under my
care, as severely and exactly as I formerly did
Messieurs Fouquet and Lauzun, who could not<a class="page" name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a>
boast that they had either sent or received any
news, while they were in confinement. These
prisoners can hear the people speak as they pass
along the road which is at the bottom of the
tower; but they, if they wished it, could not
make themselves heard; they can see the persons
on the hill which is before their windows, but
cannot themselves be seen on account of the bars
which are placed across their room. There are
two sentinels of my company always night and
day, on each side of the tower, at a reasonable
distance, who can see the window of the prisoners
obliquely. They are ordered to take care that no
one speaks to them, and that they do not cry out
from their windows; and to make the passengers
walk on if they wish to stop in the path, or on the
side of the hill. My own room being joined to
the tower, and having no other look-out except
towards this path, I hear and see every thing,
even my two sentinels, who are by this means always
kept alert.</p>

<p>As for the inside of the tower, I have divided it
in such a manner, that the priest who says mass
to them cannot see them, on account of a curtain
I have made, which covers their double doors.<a class="page" name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a>
The servants, who bring their food, put whatever
is necessary for the prisoners upon a table on the
outside, and my lieutenant takes it and carries it
in to them. No one speaks to them except myself,
my officer, M. Vigneron (the confessor), and physician
from Pragelas, which is six leagues from
hence, who only sees them in my presence. With
regard to their linen and other necessaries, I take
the same precautions which I did with my former
prisoners.</p>

<p class="salutation"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I am most grateful for the new favour, which I
have just received from his Majesty, (the government
of the Islands of Saint Margaret). If you
order me to go there without delay, I would request
to be permitted to take the road through
Piedmont, on account of the great quantity of
snow that there is between this place and Embrun;
and, on my return, which shall be as quick
as I can possibly make it, I hope you will approve
of my going by the way, to take leave of
the Duke of Savoy, from whom I have always received
so much kindness. I will give such good
orders for the guarding of my prisoner, that I
can answer to you, Sir, for his entire security, as
well as for his not now, nor ever, holding inter<a class="page" name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a>course
with my Lieutenant, whom I have forbid to
speak to him, which is punctually obeyed. If I
take him with me to the Islands, I think the most
secure conveyance will be a chair covered with oil-cloth,
in which there would enter a sufficiency of
air, without its being possible for any one to see
or speak to him during the journey, not even the
soldiers whom I shall select to be near the chair.
This conveyance will be less embarrassing than a
litter, which is liable often to break.</p>

<p>Died November 19th, 1703, aged 45, or there<a class="page" name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a>abouts;
buried at St. Paul&#8217;s the next day at four
in the afternoon, under the name of Marchiali, in
the presence of M. de Rosarges, Major of the
Fortress, and of M. Reilh, Surgeon-Major of the
Bastille, who signed their names to the extract of
the Burial Register of St. Paul&#8217;s. His burial cost
forty livres.</p>

<p>This prisoner remained at the Bastille five years
and sixty-two days, the day of his burial not included.</p>

<p>He was only ill for some hours, and died almost
suddenly; he was buried in a winding-sheet of
new linen; and for the most part every thing that
was found in his chamber was burnt, such as every
part of his bed, including the mattresses, his
tables, chairs, and other utensils, which were all
reduced to powder and to cinders, and thrown
into the drains. The rest of the things, such as
the silver, copper, and pewter, were melted.
This prisoner was lodged in the third chamber of
the tower <i>Bertaudière</i>, which room was scraped
and filed quite to the stone, and fresh white-washed
from the top to the bottom. The doors and
windows were burnt like the rest.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, in the name of Marchi<a class="page" name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a>ali,
which was given him in the Burial Register

<p class="abstract">Extract from the Work entitled &#8220;<i>La Correspondance Interceptée</i>,&#8221;
by M. Lewis Dutens, published in 1789.</p>

<p>In order to treat this subject (that of the Iron
Mask) methodically, I will begin with what the
Duke de Choiseul has often related to me. Lewis
the Fifteenth one day told him, that he was acquainted
with the history of the prisoner with the
Mask. The Duke begged the King to tell him
who he was, but he could get no other answer from
him, except, that all the conjectures which had
been hitherto made with regard to the prisoner,
were false. Some time afterwards, Madame de
Pompadour, at the request of the Duke, pressed
the King to explain himself upon this subject.
Lewis the Fifteenth upon this told her, that he believed
he was the Minister of an Italian Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the publication of the &#8220;<i>Correspondance

had spoken to Lewis the Fifteenth on the subject
of the masked prisoner; but that he had not been
able to obtain any satisfactory answer. I addressed
myself to the Abbé Barthelemi and to the Abbé
Beliardi, who had both lived in intimacy with M.
de Choiseul: they acquainted me that it was at
their request the Duke de Choiseul had spoken upon
this subject to Lewis the Fifteenth; that the King
had answered him, that he believed the prisoner
was a minister of one of the courts of Italy; but
that the Duke observed that this conversation appeared
to embarrass him. The Abbé Beliardi told
me in proper terms, that the King wished to evade
the subject. They then begged M. de Choiseul to
engage Madame de Pompadour to speak to the
King. She did so; but the answer of Lewis the
Fifteenth to his mistress was not more instructive,
than that which he had given to his Minister.</p>

<p class="abstract">Letter from the Baron de Heiss to the Authors of the

</p>

<p>Since the publication of the anecdote respecting
the Man in the Iron Mask, which M. de Voltaire
has given us in his &#8220;<i>Siècle de Louis</i> XIV.,&#8221; I have
been always very curious to discover who this prisoner
could be; but all my researches had hitherto
failed in giving me any information which could
content me; chance has placed in my hands a
detached number of a work, of which the title is
&#8220;<i>Histoire abrégée de l&#8217;Europe</i>,&#8221; for the month of
August 1687, printed that same year at Leyden,
by &#8220;<i>Claude Jordan</i>.&#8221; At the article Mantua, I
found the letter, which I have the honour to send
you a copy of, translated from the Italian. It appears
that this Secretary of the Duke of Mantua,
who is there mentioned, might very well be the
Man in the Iron Mask, transferred from Pignerol
to the Islands of Saint Margaret, and from thence
to the Bastille, in 1690, when M. de Saint-Mars<a class="page" name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a>
was made governor of it. I am the more inclined
to believe this, because, as M. de Voltaire, and all
those who have made researches on this subject,
have remarked, there did not at that time disappear
any prince, or person of consequence in any
part of Europe.</p>

<p>If you, Gentlemen, find any appearance of probability
in my remark, and if you think it can
interest the public, you are welcome to insert it
in your Journal, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of my friends tells me, that he has read in
the &#8220;<i>Histoire abrégée de l&#8217;Europe</i>,&#8221; (Vol. ii. p. 33.),
that it was said, that the Duke of Mantua had had
the intention of selling his capital town; but that
the author of this History did not believe it.</p>

<p>You are ill-informed; it is certain that this
affair was negociated, and that it was much ad<a class="page" name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a>vanced
towards a conclusion. The secretary of
the Duke, who had much influence with his master,
dissuaded him from this design; but the
doing so cost him very dear, as you shall soon
learn.</p>

<p>This faithful Minister made the Duke understand,
that it was necessary for his interest and his
honour to preserve his Duchy, and thus made
him change his intention; he did still more, he
obliged him to unite himself with the other Princes
of Italy, in order to oppose the designs of France.
It was he who negociated the interview of the
different princes, which took place at Venice last
winter, during the Carnival: this time was chosen
in order the better to conceal the plans which were
in agitation. You are without doubt aware, that
it is not an extraordinary circumstance to see many
princes and persons of condition at Venice during
that period. This Secretary went afterwards to
Rome, where he remained some time; he then
visited almost all the Courts of Italy; he went to
Venice and Genoa, and he succeeded every where
so well, that he had almost entirely detached all
those powers from the interests of France. Finally
he went to Turin with the same intention.
As he believed his negociations to be very secret<a class="page" name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a>
he often visited the Marquis D&#8217;Arcy, the French
Ambassador at the Court of Savoy; but what can
escape the penetrating eyes of France? The minister
of that crown had been informed of all the
designs of the Secretary, before his arrival at
Turin. He, however, paid him many civilities,
asked him very often to dinner, and finally invited
him to come and hunt with him, at some distance
from Turin. The Secretary, who had no time to
lose, and who thought the moment of the absence
of the French ambassador very proper for his negociations,
excused himself at first upon the plea
of his having no horses; the Ambassador offered
to lend them to him, and the Secretary dared no
longer refuse, from fear lest some portion of the
truth should be suspected. The day for the hunting
being arrived, they set off together; but they
were hardly at the distance of a league from the
town, when the Secretary was surrounded by ten
or twelve horsemen, who seized him, disguised
him, masked him, and conducted him to Pignerol.
Without doubt he was well aware who had played
him this trick, but he had no means of resistance.
At Pignerol he was thought to be too near Italy,
and, though he was guarded very carefully, it was<a class="page" name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a>
feared that the walls might tell tales; he was
therefore removed from thence, and conducted to
the Islands of Saint Margaret, where he at present
is, under the care of M. de Saint-Mars, who
is the Governor. This is a piece of news doubtless
very surprising, but not on that account the
less true.</p>

<p>To this letter are joined these reflections:&mdash;There
are reports respecting a journey made by
the Duke of Mantua to Vienna. Some politicians
think that it is the affair which happened to his
Secretary which is the cause of his journey, and
that he has a design of making an alliance with
the Emperor and the King of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="footnote-anchor">334</a></p>
